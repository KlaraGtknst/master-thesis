	abstract = {Authorship attribution supported by statistical or computational methods has a long history starting from the 19th century and is marked by the seminal study of Mosteller and Wallace (1964) on the authorship of the disputed “Federalist Papers.” During the last decade, this scientific field has been developed substantially, taking advantage of research advances in areas such as machine learning, information retrieval, and natural language processing. The plethora of available electronic texts (e.g., e-mail messages, online forum messages, blogs, source code, etc.) indicates a wide variety of applications of this technology, provided it is able to handle short and noisy text from multiple candidate authors. In this article, a survey of recent advances of the automated approaches to attributing authorship is presented, examining their characteristics for both text representation and text classification. The focus of this survey is on computational requirements and settings rather than on linguistic or literary issues. We also discuss evaluation methodologies and criteria for authorship attribution studies and list open questions that will attract future work in this area.},

Adversarial stylometry intends to attack such models by rewriting an author’s text. Our research proposes several components to facilitate deployment of these adversarial attacks in the wild, where neither data nor target models are accessible. We introduce a transformerbased extension of a lexical replacement attack, and show it achieves high transferability when trained on a weakly labeled corpus—decreasing target model performance below chance. While not completely inconspicuous, our more successful attacks also prove notably less detectable by humans. Our framework therefore provides a promising direction for future privacy-preserving adversarial attacks.},

Our generalized approach therefore reduces the required material by orders of magnitude, making unmasking applicable to authorship cases of more practical proportions. The new approach is on par with other state-ofthe-art techniques that are optimized for texts of this length: it achieves accuracies of 75–80 \%, while also allowing for easy adjustment to forensic scenarios that require higher levels of conﬁdence in the classiﬁcation.},

We address this shortcoming for the ﬁrst time in a novel experimental setup of ﬁxed authors but swapped domains between training and testing. With this setup, we reveal that approaches using character trigram features are highly susceptible to favor domain information when applied without attention to domains, suffering drops of up to 55.4 percentage points in classiﬁcation accuracy under domain swapping. We further propose a new remedy based on domain-adversarial learning and compare it to ones from the literature based on heuristic rules. Both can work well, reducing accuracy losses under domain swapping to 3.6\% and 3.9\%, respectively.},

For this first task installment, we further restrict the problem so that each pair is guaranteed to contain one human and one machine text.

	abstract = {Authorship veriﬁcation is the task of determining whether two texts were written by the same author based on a writing style analysis. Author obfuscation is the adversarial task of preventing a successful veriﬁcation by altering a text’s style so that it does not resemble that of its original author anymore. This paper introduces new algorithms for both tasks and reports on a comprehensive evaluation to ascertain the merits of the state of the art in authorship veriﬁcation to withstand obfuscation. After introducing a new generalization of the well-known unmasking algorithm for short texts, thus completing our collection of state-of-the-art algorithms for veriﬁcation, we introduce an approach that (1) models writing style diﬀerence as the Jensen-Shannon distance between the character n-gram distributions of texts, and (2) manipulates an author’s writing style in a sophisticated manner using heuristic search. For obfuscation, we explore the huge space of textual variants in order to ﬁnd a paraphrased version of the to-be-obfuscated text that has a suﬃciently high Jensen-Shannon distance at minimal costs in terms of text quality loss. We analyze, quantify, and illustrate the rationale of this approach, deﬁne paraphrasing operators, derive text length-invariant thresholds for termination, and develop an eﬀective obfuscation framework. Our authorship obfuscation approach defeats the presented state-of-the-art veriﬁcation approaches, while keeping text changes at a minimum. As a ﬁnal contribution, we discuss and experimentally evaluate a reverse obfuscation attack against our obfuscation approach as well as possible remedies.},

Our framework additionally includes an out-of-distribution detector (O2D2) for defining non-responses. Our proposed system outperformed all other systems that participated in the PAN 2021 AV task.},

	abstract = {In this work, we propose a novel approach to solve the authorship identification task on a cross-topic and open-set scenario. Authorship verification is the task of determining whether or not two texts were written by the same author. We model the documents in a graph representation and then a graph neural network extracts relevant features from these graph representations. We present three strategies to represent the texts as graphs based on the co-occurrence of the POS labels of words. We propose a Siamese Network architecture composed of graph convolutional networks along with pooling and classification layers. We present different variants of the architecture and discuss the performance of each one. To evaluate our approach we used a collection of fanfiction texts provided by the PAN@CLEF 2021 shared task in two settings: a “small” corpus and a “large” corpus. Our graph-based approach achieved average scores (AUC ROC, F1, Brier score, F0.5u, and C@1) between 90\% and 92.83\% when training on the “small” and “large” corpus, respectively. Our model obtain results comparable to those of the state of the art in this task and greater than traditional baselines.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose to use a standard BERT model for the PAN 2021 Authorship Verification task where two texts must be determined to either have the same or different authors. The model is chiefly trained to classify short sequences of text as belonging to one of three thousand authors selected from the large training dataset. Additional tasks are also used simultaneously during training in order to capitalize on the information available, namely, a masked language model task, a fandom classification task, and an author-fandom separation task. To perform Authorship Verification, an embedding is extracted from the trained BERT model. In order to reduce the computational cost, only a short sample of text is processed by BERT, but the same text is sampled a hundred times at random locations, and the embeddings from each sample are reduced to a single representation using the median. The representations from two texts are compared by cosine similarity, which is rescaled empirically so that most of the ambiguous pairs lie on the 0.5 threshold. Evaluated on authors and topics absent from the training dataset, this model achieved F1=0.832 and AUC=0.798.},

	abstract = {The syntactic structure of sentences in a document substantially informs about its authorial writing style. Sentence representation learning has been widely explored in recent years and it has been shown that it improves the generalization of different downstream tasks across many domains. Even though utilizing probing methods in several studies suggests that these learned contextual representations implicitly encode some amount of syntax, explicit syntactic information further improves the performance of deep neural models in the domain of authorship attribution. These observations have motivated us to investigate the explicit representation learning of syntactic structure of sentences. In this article, we propose a self-supervised framework for learning structural representations of sentences. The self-supervised network contains two components; a lexical sub-network and a syntactic sub-network which take the sequence of words and their corresponding structural labels as the input, respectively. Due to the
              n
              -to-1 mapping of words to their structural labels, each word will be embedded into a vector representation which mainly carries structural information. We evaluate the learned structural representations of sentences using different probing tasks, and subsequently utilize them in the authorship attribution task. Our experimental results indicate that the structural embeddings significantly improve the classification tasks when concatenated with the existing pre-trained word embeddings.},

Stylometry research has yielded several methods and tools over the past 200 years to handle a variety of challenging cases. This survey reviews several articles within five prominent subtasks: authorship attribution, authorship verification, authorship profiling, stylochronometry, and adversarial stylometry. Discussions on datasets, features, experimental techniques, and recent approaches are provided. Further, a current research challenge lies in the inability of authorship analysis techniques to scale to a large number of authors with few text samples. Here, we perform an extensive performance analysis on a corpus of 1,000 authors to investigate authorship attribution, verification, and clustering using 14 algorithms from the literature. Finally, several remaining research challenges are discussed, along with descriptions of various open-source and commercial software that may be useful for stylometry subtasks.},

	abstract = {Authorship veriﬁcation, the task of identifying if two text excerpts are from the same author, is an important part of evaluating the veracity and authenticity of writings and is one of the challenges for this year’s PAN @ CLEF 2020 event. In this paper, we describe our PAN authorship veriﬁcation submission system, a neural network that learns useful features for authorship veriﬁcation from fanﬁction texts and their corresponding fandoms. Our system uses the Longformer, a variant of state-of-the-art transformer models, that is pre-trained on large amounts of text. This model combines global self-attention and local self-attention to enable efﬁcient processing of long text inputs (like the fanﬁction data used for PAN @ CLEF 2020), and we augment the pre-trained Longformer model with additional fully-connected layers and ﬁne-tune it to learn features that are useful for author veriﬁcation. Finally, our model incorporates fandom information via the use of a multi-task loss function that optimizes for both authorship veriﬁcation and topic correspondence, allowing it to learn useful fandom features for author veriﬁcation indirectly. On a held-out subset of the PAN-provided “large training” set, our Longformer-based system attained a 0.963 overall veriﬁcation score, outperforming the PAN text compression baseline by 32.8\% relative. However, on the ofﬁcial PAN test set, our system attained a 0.685 overall score, underperforming the PAN text compression baseline by 7.6\% relative.},

	abstract = {Determining whether two documents were composed by the same author, also known as authorship veriﬁcation, has traditionally been tackled using statistical methods. Recently, authorship representations learned using neural networks have been found to outperform alternatives, particularly in large-scale settings involving hundreds of thousands of authors. But do such representations learned in a particular domain transfer to other domains? Or are these representations inherently entangled with domain-speciﬁc features? To study these questions, we conduct the ﬁrst large-scale study of cross-domain transfer for authorship veriﬁcation considering zero-shot transfers involving three disparate domains: Amazon reviews, fanﬁction short stories, and Reddit comments. We ﬁnd that although a surprising degree of transfer is possible between certain domains, it is not so successful between others. We examine properties of these domains that inﬂuence generalization and propose simple but effective methods to improve transfer.},
