	abstract = {Authorship attribution supported by statistical or computational methods has a long history starting from the 19th century and is marked by the seminal study of Mosteller and Wallace (1964) on the authorship of the disputed “Federalist Papers.” During the last decade, this scientific field has been developed substantially, taking advantage of research advances in areas such as machine learning, information retrieval, and natural language processing. The plethora of available electronic texts (e.g., e-mail messages, online forum messages, blogs, source code, etc.) indicates a wide variety of applications of this technology, provided it is able to handle short and noisy text from multiple candidate authors. In this article, a survey of recent advances of the automated approaches to attributing authorship is presented, examining their characteristics for both text representation and text classification. The focus of this survey is on computational requirements and settings rather than on linguistic or literary issues. We also discuss evaluation methodologies and criteria for authorship attribution studies and list open questions that will attract future work in this area.},

Our research proposes several components to facilitate deployment of these adversarial attacks in the wild, where neither data nor target models are accessible. We introduce a transformerbased extension of a lexical replacement attack, and show it achieves high transferability when trained on a weakly labeled corpus—decreasing target model performance below chance. While not completely inconspicuous, our more successful attacks also prove notably less detectable by humans. Our framework therefore provides a promising direction for future privacy-preserving adversarial attacks.},

For this task, unmasking is one of the most robust approaches as of today with the major shortcoming of only being applicable to book-length texts. In this paper, we present a generalized unmasking approach which allows for authorship veriﬁcation of texts as short as four printed pages with very high precision at an adjustable recall tradeoff. Our generalized approach therefore reduces the required material by orders of magnitude, making unmasking applicable to authorship cases of more practical proportions. The new approach is on par with other state-ofthe-art techniques that are optimized for texts of this length: it achieves accuracies of 75–80 \%, while also allowing for easy adjustment to forensic scenarios that require higher levels of conﬁdence in the classiﬁcation.},

We formulate the task in a way that is reminiscent of a traditional authorship verification problem, where given a pair of texts, their human or machine authorship is to be inferred. For this first task installment, we further restrict the problem so that each pair is guaranteed to contain one human and one machine text. Hence the task description reads: Given two texts, one authored by a human, one by a machine: pick out the human.},

	abstract = {Authorship verification is the task of determining whether two texts were written by the same author based on a writing style analysis. Author obfuscation is the adversarial task of preventing a successful veriﬁcation by altering a text’s style so that it does not resemble that of its original author anymore. This paper introduces new algorithms for both tasks and reports on a comprehensive evaluation to ascertain the merits of the state of the art in authorship veriﬁcation to withstand obfuscation. After introducing a new generalization of the well-known unmasking algorithm for short texts, thus completing our collection of state-of-the-art algorithms for veriﬁcation, we introduce an approach that (1) models writing style diﬀerence as the Jensen-Shannon distance between the character n-gram distributions of texts, and (2) manipulates an author’s writing style in a sophisticated manner using heuristic search. For obfuscation, we explore the huge space of textual variants in order to ﬁnd a paraphrased version of the to-be-obfuscated text that has a suﬃciently high Jensen-Shannon distance at minimal costs in terms of text quality loss. We analyze, quantify, and illustrate the rationale of this approach, deﬁne paraphrasing operators, derive text length-invariant thresholds for termination, and develop an eﬀective obfuscation framework. Our authorship obfuscation approach defeats the presented state-of-the-art veriﬁcation approaches, while keeping text changes at a minimum. As a ﬁnal contribution, we discuss and experimentally evaluate a reverse obfuscation attack against our obfuscation approach as well as possible remedies.},

Authorship verification is the task of determining whether or not two texts were written by the same author. We model the documents in a graph representation and then a graph neural network extracts relevant features from these graph representations. We present three strategies to represent the texts as graphs based on the co-occurrence of the POS labels of words. We propose a Siamese Network architecture composed of graph convolutional networks along with pooling and classification layers. We present different variants of the architecture and discuss the performance of each one. To evaluate our approach we used a collection of fanfiction texts provided by the PAN@CLEF 2021 shared task in two settings: a “small” corpus and a “large” corpus. Our graph-based approach achieved average scores (AUC ROC, F1, Brier score, F0.5u, and C@1) between 90\% and 92.83\% when training on the “small” and “large” corpus, respectively. Our model obtain results comparable to those of the state of the art in this task and greater than traditional baselines.},

The model is chiefly trained to classify short sequences of text as belonging to one of three thousand authors selected from the large training dataset. Additional tasks are also used simultaneously during training in order to capitalize on the information available, namely, a masked language model task, a fandom classification task, and an author-fandom separation task. To perform Authorship Verification, an embedding is extracted from the trained BERT model. In order to reduce the computational cost, only a short sample of text is processed by BERT, but the same text is sampled a hundred times at random locations, and the embeddings from each sample are reduced to a single representation using the median. The representations from two texts are compared by cosine similarity, which is rescaled empirically so that most of the ambiguous pairs lie on the 0.5 threshold. Evaluated on authors and topics absent from the training dataset, this model achieved F1=0.832 and AUC=0.798.},

Sentence representation learning has been widely explored in recent years and it has been shown that it improves the generalization of different downstream tasks across many domains. Even though utilizing probing methods in several studies suggests that these learned contextual representations implicitly encode some amount of syntax, explicit syntactic information further improves the performance of deep neural models in the domain of authorship attribution. These observations have motivated us to investigate the explicit representation learning of syntactic structure of sentences. In this article, we propose a self-supervised framework for learning structural representations of sentences. The self-supervised network contains two components; a lexical sub-network and a syntactic sub-network which take the sequence of words and their corresponding structural labels as the input, respectively. Due to the
              n
              -to-1 mapping of words to their structural labels, each word will be embedded into a vector representation which mainly carries structural information. We evaluate the learned structural representations of sentences using different probing tasks, and subsequently utilize them in the authorship attribution task. Our experimental results indicate that the structural embeddings significantly improve the classification tasks when concatenated with the existing pre-trained word embeddings.},

Our system uses the Longformer, a variant of state-of-the-art transformer models, that is pre-trained on large amounts of text. This model combines global self-attention and local self-attention to enable efﬁcient processing of long text inputs (like the fanﬁction data used for PAN @ CLEF 2020), and we augment the pre-trained Longformer model with additional fully-connected layers and ﬁne-tune it to learn features that are useful for author veriﬁcation. Finally, our model incorporates fandom information via the use of a multi-task loss function that optimizes for both authorship veriﬁcation and topic correspondence, allowing it to learn useful fandom features for author veriﬁcation indirectly. On a held-out subset of the PAN-provided “large training” set, our Longformer-based system attained a 0.963 overall veriﬁcation score, outperforming the PAN text compression baseline by 32.8\% relative. However, on the ofﬁcial PAN test set, our system attained a 0.685 overall score, underperforming the PAN text compression baseline by 7.6\% relative.},

To study these questions, we conduct the ﬁrst large-scale study of cross-domain transfer for authorship veriﬁcation considering zero-shot transfers involving three disparate domains: Amazon reviews, fanﬁction short stories, and Reddit comments. We ﬁnd that although a surprising degree of transfer is possible between certain domains, it is not so successful between others.

We incorporated a rich set of stylistic features, including lexical, syntactic, structural, content-specific, and idiosyncratic attributes. We also developed the Writeprints technique for identification and similarity detection of anonymous identities. Writeprints is a Karhunen-Loeve transforms-based technique that uses a sliding window and pattern disruption algorithm with individual author-level feature sets. The Writeprints technique and extended feature set were evaluated on a testbed encompassing four online datasets spanning different domains: email, instant messaging, feedback comments, and program code. Writeprints outperformed benchmark techniques, including SVM, Ensemble SVM, PCA, and standard Karhunen-Loeve transforms, on the identification and similarity detection tasks with accuracy as high as 94\% when differentiating between 100 authors. The extended feature set also significantly outperformed a baseline set of features commonly used in previous research. Furthermore, individual-author-level feature sets generally outperformed use of a single group of attributes.},

We show how a style analysis can distinguish hyperpartisan news from the mainstream (F1 = 0.78), and satire from both (F1 = 0.81). But stylometry is no silver bullet as style-based fake news detection does not work (F1 = 0.46). We further reveal that left-wing and right-wing news share signiﬁcantly more stylistic similarities than either does with the mainstream. This result is robust: it has been conﬁrmed by three different modeling approaches, one of which employs Unmasking in a novel way.

Despite progress in automated paraphrase detection, inconsistencies in training datasets often limit their effectiveness. This study examines traditional and modern approaches to paraphrase identification, revealing how the under-representation of certain paraphrase types in widely-used datasets, including those for training Large Language Models (LLMs), undermines plagiarism detection accuracy. To address these issues, we introduce and validate ReParaphrased, a refined paraphrase typology, and extend the Extended Typology Paraphrase Corpus (ETPC) with meticulous manual annotations to enhance reliability. Using the augmented ETPC, we fine-tune the LLama3.1-7B-instruct model, uncovering significant disparities in paraphrase type distribution across existing datasets. A detailed analysis of the MRPC benchmark dataset further highlights critical distributional issues and their implications. We propose four key solutions to address dataset limitations, providing both theoretical and practical guidance for improving dataset quality. These contributions aim to establish a more robust foundation for NLP model training and evaluation. Finally, we outline future research directions and suggest improvements for dataset development to advance AI-driven paraphrase detection.},

	abstract = {Paraphrase Generation is one of the most important and challenging tasks in the field of Natural Language Generation. The paraphrasing techniques help to identify or to extract/generate phrases/sentences conveying the similar meaning. The paraphrasing task can be bifurcated into two sub-tasks namely, Paraphrase Identification (PI) and Paraphrase Generation (PG). Most of the existing proposed state-of-the-art systems have the potential to solve only one problem at a time. This paper proposes a light-weight unified model that can simultaneously classify whether given pair of sentences are paraphrases of each other and the model can also generate multiple paraphrases given an input sentence. Paraphrase Generation module aims to generate fluent and semantically similar paraphrases and the Paraphrase Identification system aims to classify whether sentences pair are paraphrases of each other or not. The proposed approach uses an amalgamation of data sampling or data variety with a granular fine-tuned Text-To-Text Transfer Transformer (T5) model. This paper proposes a unified approach which aims to solve the problems of Paraphrase Identification and generation by using carefully selected data-points and a fine-tuned T5 model. The highlight of this study is that the same light-weight model trained by keeping the objective of Paraphrase Generation can also be used for solving the Paraphrase Identification task. Hence, the proposed system is light-weight in terms of the model’s size along with the data used to train the model which facilitates the quick learning of the model without having to compromise with the results. The proposed system is then evaluated against the popular evaluation metrics like BLEU (BiLingual Evaluation Understudy):, ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation), METEOR, WER (Word Error Rate), and GLEU (Google-BLEU) for Paraphrase Generation and classification metrics like accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score for Paraphrase Identification system. The proposed model achieves state-of-the-art results on both the tasks of Paraphrase Identification and paraphrase Generation.},

	abstract = {Paraphrase generation is a fundamental natural language processing (NLP) task that refers to the process of generating a well-formed and coherent output sentence that exhibits both syntactic and/or lexical diversity from the input sentence, while simultaneously ensuring that the semantic similarity between the two sentences is preserved. However, the availability of high-quality paraphrase datasets has been limited, particularly for machine-generated sentences. In this paper, we present ParaGPT, a new paraphrase dataset of 81,000 machine-generated sentence pairs, including 27,000 reference sentences (ChatGPT-generated sentences), and 81,000 paraphrases obtained by using three different large language models (LLMs): ChatGPT, GPT-3, and T5. We used ChatGPT to generate 27,000 sentences that cover a diverse array of topics and sentence structures, thus providing diverse inputs for the models. In addition, we evaluated the quality of the generated paraphrases using various automatic evaluation metrics. Furthermore, we provide insights into the strengths and drawbacks of each LLM in generating paraphrases by conducting a comparative analysis of the paraphrasing performance of the three LLMs. According to our findings, ChatGPT's performance, as per the evaluation metrics provided, was deemed impressive and commendable, owing to its higher-than-average scores for semantic similarity, which implies a higher degree of similarity between the generated paraphrase and the reference sentence, and its relatively lower scores for syntactic diversity, indicating a greater diversity of syntactic structures in the generated paraphrase. ParaGPT is a valuable resource for researchers working on NLP tasks like paraphrasing, text simplification, and text generation. We make the ParaGPT dataset publicly accessible to researchers, and as far as we are aware, this is the first paraphrase dataset produced based on ChatGPT.},

Previous research has regarded this issue as a problem of the model’s robustness to question paraphrase and proposed a retraining method to address it. However, retraining faces challenges in meeting the computational costs and privacy security demands of LLMs. In this paper, we regard this issue as a problem of alignment with model preferences and propose PEARL (Preference-drivEn pAraphRase Learning). This is a black-box method that enhances model performance by paraphrasing questions in expressions preferred by the model. We validate PEARL across six datasets spanning three tasks: open-domain QA, commonsense reasoning, and math word problem. Extensive experiments demonstrated not only the outstanding performance but also the composability, transferability, and immense potential of PEARL, shedding new light on the blackbox tuning of LLMs1.},

	abstract = {Background: The introduction of ChatGPT by OpenAI has garnered significant attention. Among its capabilities, paraphrasing stands out.
Objective: This study aims to investigate the satisfactory levels of plagiarism in the paraphrased text produced by this chatbot.
Methods: Three texts of varying lengths were presented to ChatGPT. ChatGPT was then instructed to paraphrase the provided texts using five different prompts. In the subsequent stage of the study, the texts were divided into separate paragraphs, and ChatGPT was requested to paraphrase each paragraph individually. Lastly, in the third stage, ChatGPT was asked to paraphrase the texts it had previously generated.
Results: The average plagiarism rate in the texts generated by ChatGPT was 45\% (SD 10\%). ChatGPT exhibited a substantial reduction in plagiarism for the provided texts (mean difference −0.51, 95\% CI −0.54 to −0.48; P{\textless}.001). Furthermore, when comparing the second attempt with the initial attempt, a significant decrease in the plagiarism rate was observed (mean difference −0.06, 95\% CI −0.08 to −0.03; P{\textless}.001). The number of paragraphs in the texts demonstrated a noteworthy association with the percentage of plagiarism, with texts consisting of a single paragraph exhibiting the lowest plagiarism rate (P{\textless}.001).
Conclusion: Although ChatGPT demonstrates a notable reduction of plagiarism within texts, the existing levels of plagiarism remain relatively high. This underscores a crucial caution for researchers when incorporating this chatbot into their work.},

Unigrams can be matched based on their surface forms, stemmed forms, and meanings; furthermore, METEOR can be easily extended to include more advanced matching strategies. Once all generalized unigram matches between the two strings have been found, METEOR computes a score for this matching using a combination of unigram-precision, unigram-recall, and a measure of fragmentation that is designed to directly capture how well-ordered the matched words in the machine translation are in relation to the reference. We evaluate METEOR by measuring the correlation between the metric scores and human judgments of translation quality. We compute the Pearson R correlation value between its scores and human quality assessments of the LDC TIDES 2003 Arabic-to-English and Chinese-to-English datasets. We perform segment-bysegment correlation, and show that METEOR gets an R correlation value of 0.347 on the Arabic data and 0.331 on the Chinese data. This is shown to be an improvement on using simply unigramprecision, unigram-recall and their harmonic F1 combination. We also perform experiments to show the relative contributions of the various mapping modules.},

	abstract = {Since paraphrasing is an ill-defined task, the term “paraphrasing” covers text transformation tasks with different characteristics. Consequently, existing paraphrasing studies have applied quite different (explicit and implicit) criteria as to when a pair of texts is to be considered a paraphrase, all of which amount to postulating a certain level of semantic or lexical similarity. In this paper, we conduct a literature review and propose a taxonomy to organize the 25 identified paraphrasing (sub-)tasks. Using classifiers trained to identify the tasks that a given paraphrasing instance fits, we find that the distributions of task-specific instances in the known paraphrase corpora vary substantially. This means that the use of these corpora, without the respective paraphrase conditions being clearly defined (which is the normal case), must lead to incomparable and misleading results.},

To demonstrate the suitability of this idea, we analyze captions in the English Wikipedia, where editors frequently relabel the same image for different articles. The paper introduces the underlying mining technology, the resulting Wikipedia-IPC dataset, and compares known paraphrase corpora with respect to their syntactic and semantic paraphrase similarity to our new resource.

In this paper, we identify a property of the structure of an LLM’s probability function that is useful for such detection. Specifically, we demonstrate that text sampled from an LLM tends to occupy negative curvature regions of the model’s log probability function. Leveraging this observation, we then define a new curvature-based criterion for judging if a passage is generated from a given LLM. This approach, which we call DetectGPT, does not require training a separate classifier, collecting a dataset of real or generated passages, or explicitly watermarking generated text. It uses only log probabilities computed by the model of interest and random perturbations of the passage from another generic pre-trained language model (e.g., T5). We find DetectGPT is more discriminative than existing zero-shot methods for model sample detection, notably improving detection of fake news articles generated by 20B parameter GPT-NeoX from 0.81 AUROC for the strongest zero-shot baseline to 0.95 AUROC for DetectGPT.

Consequently, there is an urgent need for a highly practical detection tool capable of accurately identifying the source of a given text. However, existing detection tools typically rely on access to LLMs and can only differentiate between machine-generated and human-authored text, failing to meet the requirements of fine-grained tracing, intermediary judgment, and rapid detection. Therefore, we propose LLMDet, a model-specific, secure, efficient, and extendable detection tool, that can source text from specific LLMs, such as GPT-2, OPT, LLaMA, and others. In LLMDet, we record the nexttoken probabilities of salient n-gram as features to calculate proxy perplexity for each LLM. By jointly analyzing the proxy perplexities of LLMs, we can determine the source of the generated text. Experimental results show that LLMDet yields impressive detection performance while ensuring speed and security, achieving 98.54\% precision and about ×5.0 faster for recognizing human-authored text. Additionally, LLMDet can effortlessly extend its detection capabilities to a new open-source model. We will provide an open-source tool at https://github.com/TrustedLLM/LLMDet.},

	abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) present significant risks when used to generate non-factual content and spread disinformation at scale. Detecting such LLM-generated content is crucial, yet current detectors often struggle to generalize in open-world contexts. We introduce Learning2Rewrite, a novel framework for detecting AI-generated text with exceptional generalization to unseen domains. Our method leverages the insight that LLMs inherently modify AI-generated content less than human-written text when tasked with rewriting. By training LLMs to minimize alterations on AI-generated inputs, we amplify this disparity, yielding a more distinguishable and generalizable edit distance across diverse text distributions. Extensive experiments on data from 21 independent domains and four major LLMs (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Gemini, and Llama-3) demonstrate that our detector outperforms stateof-the-art detection methods by up to 23.04\% in AUROC for in-distribution tests, 37.26\% for out-of-distribution tests, and 48.66\% under adversarial attacks. Our unique training objective ensures better generalizability compared to directly training for classification, when leveraging the same amount of parameters. Our findings suggest that reinforcing LLMs’ inherent rewriting tendencies offers a robust and scalable solution for detecting AI-generated text.},
