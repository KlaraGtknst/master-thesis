	title = {Will {Longformers} {PAN} {Out} for {Authorship} {Veriﬁcation}?},
	abstract = {Authorship veriﬁcation, the task of identifying if two text excerpts are from the same author, is an important part of evaluating the veracity and authenticity of writings and is one of the challenges for this year’s PAN @ CLEF 2020 event. In this paper, we describe our PAN authorship veriﬁcation submission system, a neural network that learns useful features for authorship veriﬁcation from fanﬁction texts and their corresponding fandoms. Our system uses the Longformer, a variant of state-of-the-art transformer models, that is pre-trained on large amounts of text. This model combines global self-attention and local self-attention to enable efﬁcient processing of long text inputs (like the fanﬁction data used for PAN @ CLEF 2020), and we augment the pre-trained Longformer model with additional fully-connected layers and ﬁne-tune it to learn features that are useful for author veriﬁcation. Finally, our model incorporates fandom information via the use of a multi-task loss function that optimizes for both authorship veriﬁcation and topic correspondence, allowing it to learn useful fandom features for author veriﬁcation indirectly. On a held-out subset of the PAN-provided “large training” set, our Longformer-based system attained a 0.963 overall veriﬁcation score, outperforming the PAN text compression baseline by 32.8\% relative. However, on the ofﬁcial PAN test set, our system attained a 0.685 overall score, underperforming the PAN text compression baseline by 7.6\% relative.},

	abstract = {Background: The introduction of ChatGPT by OpenAI has garnered significant attention. Among its capabilities, paraphrasing stands out.
Objective: This study aims to investigate the satisfactory levels of plagiarism in the paraphrased text produced by this chatbot.
Methods: Three texts of varying lengths were presented to ChatGPT. ChatGPT was then instructed to paraphrase the provided texts using five different prompts. In the subsequent stage of the study, the texts were divided into separate paragraphs, and ChatGPT was requested to paraphrase each paragraph individually. Lastly, in the third stage, ChatGPT was asked to paraphrase the texts it had previously generated.
Results: The average plagiarism rate in the texts generated by ChatGPT was 45\% (SD 10\%). ChatGPT exhibited a substantial reduction in plagiarism for the provided texts (mean difference −0.51, 95\% CI −0.54 to −0.48; P{\textless}.001). Furthermore, when comparing the second attempt with the initial attempt, a significant decrease in the plagiarism rate was observed (mean difference −0.06, 95\% CI −0.08 to −0.03; P{\textless}.001). The number of paragraphs in the texts demonstrated a noteworthy association with the percentage of plagiarism, with texts consisting of a single paragraph exhibiting the lowest plagiarism rate (P{\textless}.001).
Conclusion: Although ChatGPT demonstrates a notable reduction of plagiarism within texts, the existing levels of plagiarism remain relatively high. This underscores a crucial caution for researchers when incorporating this chatbot into their work.},

This paper introduces four different ROUGE measures: ROUGE-N, ROUGE-L, ROUGE-W, and ROUGE-S included in the ROUGE summarization evaluation package and their evaluatio ns.

In this work, we evaluated our Cross-Encoder system with four Transformers using differently tuned variants of fanfiction data and found that our BigBird pipeline outperformed Longformer, RoBERTa, and ELECTRA and performed competitively against the official top ranked system from the PAN evaluation. We also examined the effect of authors and fandoms not seen in training on model performance. Through this, we found fandom has the greatest influence on true trials, and that a balanced training dataset in terms of class and fandom performed the most consistently."
