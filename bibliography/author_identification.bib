	abstract = {Authorship attribution supported by statistical or computational methods has a long history starting from the 19th century and is marked by the seminal study of Mosteller and Wallace (1964) on the authorship of the disputed “Federalist Papers.” During the last decade, this scientific field has been developed substantially, taking advantage of research advances in areas such as machine learning, information retrieval, and natural language processing. The plethora of available electronic texts (e.g., e-mail messages, online forum messages, blogs, source code, etc.) indicates a wide variety of applications of this technology, provided it is able to handle short and noisy text from multiple candidate authors. In this article, a survey of recent advances of the automated approaches to attributing authorship is presented, examining their characteristics for both text representation and text classification. The focus of this survey is on computational requirements and settings rather than on linguistic or literary issues. We also discuss evaluation methodologies and criteria for authorship attribution studies and list open questions that will attract future work in this area.},

	abstract = {Research in automatic text plagiarism detection focuses on algorithms that compare suspicious documents against a collection of reference documents. Recent approaches perform well in identifying copied or modiﬁed foreign sections, but they assume a closed world where a reference collection is given. This article investigates the question whether plagiarism can be detected by a computer program if no reference can be provided, e.g., if the foreign sections stem from a book that is not available in digital form. We call this problem class intrinsic plagiarism analysis; it is closely related to the problem of authorship veriﬁcation.},

	abstract = {The goal of the PAN lab is to advance the state of the art in text forensics and stylometry through an objective evaluation of new and established methods on new benchmark datasets. In 2024, we organized four shared tasks: (1) multi-author writing style analysis, which we continue from 2023; (2) multilingual text detoxification, a new task that aims to re-formulate text in a non-toxic way for multiple languages; (3) oppositional thinking analysis, a new task that aims to discriminate critical thinking from conspiracy narratives and identify their core actors; and (4) generative AI authorship verification, which formulates the detection of AI-generated text as an authorship problem. PAN 2024 concluded as one of our most successful editions with 74 notebook papers by 147 participating teams.},

	abstract = {Analyzing the writing style of individual authors in texts in which several authors are involved is a fundamental task in attributing authorship and detecting plagiarism, as it makes it possible to identify the points at which authorship changes. This year’s multi-author writing style analysis task focuses on identifying all instances of paragraph-level writing style changes within a given text. We provide datasets with three different degrees of topical homogeneity to investigate how different degrees of topic consistency affect the detection of writing style changes. This paper gives an overview of the task, its definition and the data used, the approaches proposed by the participants, and the results obtained.},

	abstract = {Written language contains stylistic cues that can be exploited to automatically infer a variety of potentially sensitive author information. Adversarial stylometry intends to attack such models by rewriting an author’s text. Our research proposes several components to facilitate deployment of these adversarial attacks in the wild, where neither data nor target models are accessible. We introduce a transformerbased extension of a lexical replacement attack, and show it achieves high transferability when trained on a weakly labeled corpus—decreasing target model performance below chance. While not completely inconspicuous, our more successful attacks also prove notably less detectable by humans. Our framework therefore provides a promising direction for future privacy-preserving adversarial attacks.},
