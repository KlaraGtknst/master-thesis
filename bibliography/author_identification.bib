	abstract = {Authorship attribution supported by statistical or computational methods has a long history starting from the 19th century and is marked by the seminal study of Mosteller and Wallace (1964) on the authorship of the disputed “Federalist Papers.” During the last decade, this scientific field has been developed substantially, taking advantage of research advances in areas such as machine learning, information retrieval, and natural language processing. The plethora of available electronic texts (e.g., e-mail messages, online forum messages, blogs, source code, etc.) indicates a wide variety of applications of this technology, provided it is able to handle short and noisy text from multiple candidate authors. In this article, a survey of recent advances of the automated approaches to attributing authorship is presented, examining their characteristics for both text representation and text classification. The focus of this survey is on computational requirements and settings rather than on linguistic or literary issues. We also discuss evaluation methodologies and criteria for authorship attribution studies and list open questions that will attract future work in this area.},

Adversarial stylometry intends to attack such models by rewriting an author’s text. Our research proposes several components to facilitate deployment of these adversarial attacks in the wild, where neither data nor target models are accessible. We introduce a transformerbased extension of a lexical replacement attack, and show it achieves high transferability when trained on a weakly labeled corpus—decreasing target model performance below chance. While not completely inconspicuous, our more successful attacks also prove notably less detectable by humans. Our framework therefore provides a promising direction for future privacy-preserving adversarial attacks.},

For this task, unmasking is one of the most robust approaches as of today with the major shortcoming of only being applicable to book-length texts. In this paper, we present a generalized unmasking approach which allows for authorship veriﬁcation of texts as short as four printed pages with very high precision at an adjustable recall tradeoff. Our generalized approach therefore reduces the required material by orders of magnitude, making unmasking applicable to authorship cases of more practical proportions. The new approach is on par with other state-ofthe-art techniques that are optimized for texts of this length: it achieves accuracies of 75–80 \%, while also allowing for easy adjustment to forensic scenarios that require higher levels of conﬁdence in the classiﬁcation.},

In this regard, we present a “Basic and Fairly Flawed” (BAFF) authorship veriﬁer that is on a par with the best approaches submitted so far, and that illustrates sources of bias that should be eliminated.

	abstract = {The prerequisite of many approaches to authorship analysis is a representation of writing style. But despite decades of research, it still remains unclear to what extent commonly used and widely accepted representations like character trigram frequencies actually represent an author’s writing style, in contrast to more domain-speciﬁc style components or even topic. We address this shortcoming for the ﬁrst time in a novel experimental setup of ﬁxed authors but swapped domains between training and testing. With this setup, we reveal that approaches using character trigram features are highly susceptible to favor domain information when applied without attention to domains, suffering drops of up to 55.4 percentage points in classiﬁcation accuracy under domain swapping. We further propose a new remedy based on domain-adversarial learning and compare it to ones from the literature based on heuristic rules. Both can work well, reducing accuracy losses under domain swapping to 3.6\% and 3.9\%, respectively.},

We formulate the task in a way that is reminiscent of a traditional authorship verification problem, where given a pair of texts, their human or machine authorship is to be inferred. For this first task installment, we further restrict the problem so that each pair is guaranteed to contain one human and one machine text. Hence the task description reads: Given two texts, one authored by a human, one by a machine: pick out the human.},

	abstract = {Authorship veriﬁcation is the task of determining whether two texts were written by the same author based on a writing style analysis. Author obfuscation is the adversarial task of preventing a successful veriﬁcation by altering a text’s style so that it does not resemble that of its original author anymore. This paper introduces new algorithms for both tasks and reports on a comprehensive evaluation to ascertain the merits of the state of the art in authorship veriﬁcation to withstand obfuscation. After introducing a new generalization of the well-known unmasking algorithm for short texts, thus completing our collection of state-of-the-art algorithms for veriﬁcation, we introduce an approach that (1) models writing style diﬀerence as the Jensen-Shannon distance between the character n-gram distributions of texts, and (2) manipulates an author’s writing style in a sophisticated manner using heuristic search. For obfuscation, we explore the huge space of textual variants in order to ﬁnd a paraphrased version of the to-be-obfuscated text that has a suﬃciently high Jensen-Shannon distance at minimal costs in terms of text quality loss. We analyze, quantify, and illustrate the rationale of this approach, deﬁne paraphrasing operators, derive text length-invariant thresholds for termination, and develop an eﬀective obfuscation framework. Our authorship obfuscation approach defeats the presented state-of-the-art veriﬁcation approaches, while keeping text changes at a minimum. As a ﬁnal contribution, we discuss and experimentally evaluate a reverse obfuscation attack against our obfuscation approach as well as possible remedies.},
