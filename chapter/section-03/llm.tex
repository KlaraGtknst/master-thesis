\section{Impact of \acs{llm} on \ai{}}

With advances of generative \acp{llm} with regard to mimicking human writing, we have to face the fact that \acp{llm} will play a crucial role in any \ai{} related tasks from now on.
Since there is not \textit{the one} \ac{llm}, but a great variety of \acp{llm}, one may find denoting \acp{llm} an author deceptive.
This implicates individual authorships for different \acp{llm}.
Recent research~\citep{llm_detection_av_2025}, claimed that \ac{llm} detection is not an \ac{aa} task, i.e., a closed-set binary classification where both classes are sufficiently discriminative, but an \ac{av} task, i.e., an open-set one-class classification problem. 

% differences
Despite the advances, there are still some statistical differences on \ac{llm} generated and human authored texts.
\ac{llm} generated text lacks lexical diversity, overuses certain adjectives ("commendable", "innovative", "meticulous", etc.) and produces longer, more complex sentences.
Moreover, \acp{llm} possess stylistic fingerprints and memorize patterns from the training data.
% lengths
Word length averages and distributions across genre differ for \acp{llm} and humans~\citep{llm_detection_av_2025}.

% future of LLMs
However, as \acp{llm} advance, basic heuristics applied by human detectors no longer suffice.
\acp{llm} will become more human-like and thus, \ac{llm} detection will increasingly resemble a human authorship classification task~\citep{llm_detection_av_2025}.
