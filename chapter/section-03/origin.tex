\subsection{Origin}

\ai{} became popular to verify authorship of literary texts.
\ai{} is especially interesting if the candidate's authorship claim contradicts the public opinion for any reason.
Given popular literary mysteries' authors have long died, the question of rightful \ai{} remains to be solved without consolidation of the candidate author leaving other dimensions to explore.
Popular examples of \ai{} include Shakespeare \textcolor{red}{TODO: reference}, or a collection of Hebrew-Aramaic letters supposedly by a rabbinic scholar in Baghdad in the late 19th century~\citep{koppel_authorship_2004}.
The latter denied having authored the text collection, which was contested by \citet{koppel_authorship_2004}.
