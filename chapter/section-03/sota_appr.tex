\section{\Acl{sota} Methods}
\label{sec:sota_methods}

The following sections introduce established \ac{av} approaches.
We start with compression-based methods, as detailed in \Cref{subsec:compression_based}, proceed to both traditional and generalised \unmasking{} covered by \Cref{subsec:unmasking}, and conclude with the traditional \impAppr{}, discussed in \Cref{sec:impostor_method_theory}.
