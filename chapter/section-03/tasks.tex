\section{Tasks}

In this section we outline the main tasks of authorship analysis. 
We begin with the foundational problems of \ac{aa} and \ac{av}, before turning to derivative tasks such as author profiling,  author obfuscation, and plagiarism detection.

\subsection{\acl{aa}}
\ac{aa} is the classical multiclass, single-label text classification task in which, given a set of candidate authors with known writings, the goal is to determine which author wrote a disputed text % \citep{stein_intrinsic_2011,koppel_authorship_2004,stamatatos_survey_2009,tyo_state_2022,bischoff_importance_2020,barlas_cross_domain_2020,altakrori_topic_2021,bevendorff_divergence_based_2020,elmanarelbouanani_authorship_2014,abbasi_writeprints_2008,llm_detection_av_2025,neal_surveying_2018,sapkota_cross_topic_2014sapkota_cross_topic_2014}
    \textcolor{red}{TODO: too many references}. 
Formally, let $A$ be the set of authors, $K=\bigcup_{a\in A} K_a$ the set of known texts, and $U$ the set of unknown texts. 
In the closed-set setting, each $d \in U$ must be attributed to exactly one $a \in A$. 
Variants such as cross-topic or cross-genre \ac{aa} introduce distributional shifts between training and test data, complicating the task~\citep{barlas_cross_domain_2020}.

\subsection{\acl{av}}
\ac{av} asks whether a given text $t$ was written by a candidate author $a$, based on a set of known writings $K_a$. 
\textcolor{red}{TODO: too many references}
    % ~\citep{stein_intrinsic_2011,stamatatos_survey_2009,koppel_authorship_2011,tyo_state_2022,kocher_unine_2015,koppel_authorship_2004}.
Unlike \ac{aa}, \ac{av} lacks reliable negative examples: it is impossible to assemble a representative sample of all texts not written by $a$. 
This makes \ac{av} a more challenging classification problem than \ac{aa}~\citep{llm_detection_av_2025,neal_surveying_2018,koppel_authorship_2004}.
\ac{av} is often framed as a one-class, binary, or similarity detection task depending on the methodological perspective~\citep{neal_surveying_2018,koppel_authorship_2004}.  
\ac{aa} can be reduced to a series of \ac{av} problems, where the other direction is typically not true~\citep{barlas_cross_domain_2020,tyo_state_2022}.
% Gespr√§ch Martin Potthast 19.05.2025: problem formulation 2 is less common and in the context of very sparse (metadata) information:
% This task can also be formulated as whether two texts $t_1$ and $t_2$ are written by the same author 
% \citep{bevendorff_generalizing_2019,bevendorff_divergence_based_2020,embarcadero_ruiz_graph_based_2022,rivera_soto_learning_2021,ordonez_will_2020,futrzynski_pairwise_2021,weerasinghe_feature_vector_difference_2021,llm_detection_av_2025}.


\subsection{Author Profiling}
Author profiling infers sociolinguistic attributes of an author, such as age, gender, education, or mental health, from a set of texts. 
It is grounded in the assumption that subconscious idiosyncrasies of writing style encode personal traits~\citep{emmery_adversarial_2021,stamatatos_survey_2009,elmanarelbouanani_authorship_2014}. 
Profiling raises substantial ethical and privacy concerns due to the sensitivity of the inferred attributes.

\subsection{Author Obfuscation}
Author obfuscation is an adversarial task in which a text is deliberately modified to conceal the author's identity while preserving its semantic content. 
It directly opposes \ac{aa} and \ac{av} by aiming to neutralize stylometric features~\citep{bischoff_importance_2020,bevendorff_divergence_based_2020,gohsen_task_oriented_2024}. 

\subsection{Plagiarism Detection}
Plagiarism detection is the task of identifying reused or unattributed content in texts~\citep{stein_intrinsic_2011,gohsen_task_oriented_2024}. 
Unlike \ac{aa}, the goal is not to establish authorship but to uncover overlap between documents, regardless of author identity~\citep{elmanarelbouanani_authorship_2014}.
Hence, plagiarism detection is an application of \ac{av}~\citep{rivera_soto_learning_2021}.
