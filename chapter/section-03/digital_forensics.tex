\section{Present-Day Application} % Contemporary Relevance/ Perspective

Beyond its use on historical literary texts, \ai{} is particularly relevant in digital forensics.
It plays a vital role in combating cybercrime, where online anonymity fosters malicious behaviour~\citep{abbasi_writeprints_2008}.
Unsuspecting users fall prey to email scams, identity deception on social media, fabricated vendor ratings, and advance-fee fraud, in which victims are persuaded to disclose bank details or transfer money through elaborate deception~\citep{abbasi_writeprints_2008,neal_surveying_2018}.
Related challenges also include plagiarism, which spans domains from the arts to academia~\citep{neal_surveying_2018}.
