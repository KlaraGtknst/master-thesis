\section{Contemporary Applications} % Contemporary Relevance/ Perspective

While early work in \ai{} focused on resolving historical literary disputes, its present-day relevance lies primarily in digital forensics. 
\ac{aa} provides critical tools for addressing cybercrime, where anonymity enables identity deception, harassment, and financial fraud~\citep{abbasi_writeprints_2008}. 
Concrete applications include the detection of fraudulent e-mails, impersonation on social media, and the identification of fake product reviews that undermine trust in e-commerce platforms. 

Beyond forensic contexts, plagiarism detection constitutes another significant application area. 
Here, authorship analysis assists in identifying unacknowledged reuse of material across domains ranging from literature to academia~\citep{neal_surveying_2018}. 
Together, these examples highlight the contemporary relevance of \ai{} in safeguarding digital integrity, supporting legal investigation, and upholding standards of authorship in both professional and academic contexts.
