\subsection{Digital Forensics}

Besides \ai{} for literary texts authored long before today, \ai{} is particularly relevant to digital forensics.
\ai{} shapes the combat against cybercrime where online anonymity encourages malicious behaviour of individuals~\citep{abbasi_writeprints_2008}.
Unsuspecting users fall victim to email scams, identity deceptions in social media applications, fake ratings of vendors, or advance-fee scams, where victims are argued into providing bank account information of or transfer money by elaborate deception~\citep{abbasi_writeprints_2008,neal_surveying_2018}.
Plagiarism ranges from arts to academia~\citep{neal_surveying_2018}.
