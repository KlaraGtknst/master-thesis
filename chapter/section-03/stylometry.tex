\section{Stylometry}

% \begin{definition}
%     [Stylometry]
Stylometry is the quantitative analysis of linguistic style through measurable textual features, with the aim of distinguishing between authors.
% \end{definition}
The central assumption of stylometry is that authors unconsciously leave behind consistent idiosyncratic syntactic traces, so-called style markers, that can be exploited for authorship analysis tasks~\citep{neal_surveying_2018,bischoff_importance_2020}. 
These traces are presumed to reflect relatively stable personal traits, and stylistic habits rather than superficial properties imposed by domain (e.g. genre, register, or topic). 
The principal challenge, therefore, is to identify markers that are more reliably attributable to authorial characteristics than to domain-specific conventions.

Stylometric features, organized into broad categories in \Cref{tab:stylometric_features}, span from lexical and character statistics to semantic and application-specific indicators, with the latter often being noisier due to reliance on processing tools~\citep{stamatatos_survey_2009}.

% Static features, such as function words, word-length distributions, vocabulary richness measures, are context-free.
% Dynamic features are context-dependent attributes and include n-grams and misspelled words~\citep{abbasi_writeprints_2008}.

\paragraph{Lexical features.} 
Lexical features treat text as a sequence of tokens, such as characters, words, or sentences~\citep{stamatatos_survey_2009}. 
Distributions over character n-grams (i.e. sequences of $n$ consecutive characters) counts, word-length~\citep{stein_intrinsic_2011}, and sentence-length~\citep{stein_intrinsic_2011,abbasi_writeprints_2008} are classic for character, word, and sentence unit-based lexical features that disregard token order in the \ac{bow} fashion~\citep{neal_surveying_2018}, respectively. 
Character-level features are computationally inexpensive, language-independent, and relatively robust to noise, whereas word-level features require tokenization, are language-dependent, and more sensitive to noise~\citep{stamatatos_survey_2009}.
Idiosyncratic spelling or grammatical mistakes are also considered discriminative lexical features~\citep{abbasi_writeprints_2008,neal_surveying_2018}. 

\paragraph{Syntactic features.}
Syntactic features exploit structural information such as \ac{pos} n-grams, function words, or recurrent syntactic errors~\citep{stamatatos_survey_2009,abbasi_writeprints_2008}.
They require a robust \ac{nlp} pipelines, making them computationally more expensive and inherently language-dependent~\citep{neal_surveying_2018,stamatatos_survey_2009}.

\paragraph{Semantic features.}
Semantic features include synonym or hyponym relations, or semantic dependencies. 
They usually complement lexical and syntactic features. 
Semantic features depend on external resources (e.g. WordNet, a lexical database of semantic relations~\citep{zhou_paraphrase_2025}).


\paragraph{Application-specific features.} % (structural + content)

Application-specific features can include structural or content-related aspects. 
Structural features capture general characteristics, such as layout, file extensions, font choices, sizes, and colours~\citep{abbasi_writeprints_2008,neal_surveying_2018}. 
Certain features, in contrast, refer to elements that are only meaningful within a particular domain, for instance, the use of salutations and signatures in e-mails or programming constructs in source code. 
Content-specific frequent words may be useful within a single genre, but they should not be used across topics or genres since they conflate authorial idiosyncrasies with semantic information~\citep{abbasi_writeprints_2008}.
% Domain-specific features include ratios of quoted words and external links, number of paragraphs, and paragraphs average length for the news article domain~\citep{potthast_stylometric_2018}


In summary, stylometry's objective is to extract informative style markers which minimize influences from genre, register, or topic. 
While lexical features remain the most widely used due to their simplicity, more advanced syntactic and semantic representations, as well as domain-specific markers, can be crucial for tackling diverse real-world scenarios.
