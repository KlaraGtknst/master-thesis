% \subsection{Stylometry}

\begin{definition}
    [Stylometry]
    Stylometry refers to a linguistic research area, where literary style is quantified by statistical features.
\end{definition}
% In other words, stylometry is the statistical analysis of literary style between one writer or genre and another \citep{tyo_state_2022}.
Researchers working on stylometric features believe that subconscious authorial syntactic idiosyncrasies are quantifiably measurable and sufficient to define an author's unique style~\citep{neal_surveying_2018}. 
These stylometric features are also referred to as style markers, or stylistic features if they are the most effective discriminators of authorship. 
Static features are context-free such as function words, word-length distributions, vocabulary richness measures, and dynamic features context-dependent attributes and include $n$-grams and misspelled words~\citep{abbasi_writeprints_2008}.
% Stylometric features include lexical, syntactic and structural features \citep{stein_intrinsic_2011}.
% Research includes five subtasks \citep{neal_surveying_2018}:
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item \ac{aa}
%     \item \ac{av}
%     \item Author profiling
%     \item Stylochronometry
%     \item adversarial stylometry
% \end{itemize}
We outline prominent style marker taxonomy categories in \autoref{tab:stylometric_features} in the following. 
Generally speaking, the more detailed the style marker extraction process, the more noisy are the produced measures~\citep{stamatatos_survey_2009}.

% lexical
Lexical features treat text as a mere sequence tokens~\citep{stamatatos_survey_2009}.
Token units include character, word, and sentence.
We \autoref{tab:comp_lexical} we present characteristics of the character and word feature units.
Character (n-gram) counts, average word~\citep{stein_intrinsic_2011}, sentence length~\citep{stein_intrinsic_2011,abbasi_writeprints_2008}, are examples for character, sentence, and sentence unit-based lexical features.
% line length~\citep{abbasi_writeprints_2008}, word length distribution~\citep{abbasi_writeprints_2008}, 
% vocabulary richness~\citep{abbasi_writeprints_2008,neal_surveying_2018} ...) 
Errors in \autoref{tab:stylometric_features} refers to idiosyncratic features include misspellings, grammatical mistakes, and other usage anomalies~\citep{abbasi_writeprints_2008,neal_surveying_2018}.

    word & high & \xmark  & high  & \checkmark    \\
    \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}%

\end{table}

% syntactic
Syntax or syntactic structure is the structural organization of sentences \citep{kurt_pehlivanoglu_comparative_2024}.
Given robust \ac{nlp} tools, syntactic features are considered more reliable than lexical features.
Well-established syntactic features built on function words, or on syntactic errors such as mismatched tense or sentence fragments, or use morpho-syntactic \ac{pos} tags for each word token for \ac{pos} tag (n-gram) frequencies~\citep{abbasi_writeprints_2008,stamatatos_survey_2009}.
It is evident, that every syntactic feature requires parsing or processing of natural language and is thus, language-dependent~\citep{neal_surveying_2018,stamatatos_survey_2009}.



% semantic
Semantic features capture meaning behind words, phrases, and sentences, such as through analysis of synonyms and semantic dependencies \citep{neal_surveying_2018}.
Semantic similarities between words, synonym or hyponym relationships are derived using WordNet, any thesaurus or latent semantic analysis.
Semantic dependencies such as the specification of a person with location, can boost classification performance when combined with lexical and syntactic information~\cite{stamatatos_survey_2009}.

% application specific/ structural
\begin{definition}
    [Structural features]
    Structural features include text organization, layout, file extensions, font, sizes, colours, 
    use of braces and comments (for analysing computer programs) \citep{abbasi_writeprints_2008,neal_surveying_2018}.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
    [Content-specific features]
    Content-specific features include important keywords and phrases on certain topics such as word $n$-grams \citep{abbasi_writeprints_2008}.
    Domain-specific features include ratios of quoted words and external links, number of paragraphs, 
    and paragraphs average length for the news article domain \citep{potthast_stylometric_2018}
\end{definition}
