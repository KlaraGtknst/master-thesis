% motivation
Historically, authorship analysis focused on literary disputes~\citep{neal_surveying_2018,stamatatos_survey_2009}, but contemporary concerns have shifted towards practical applications.
In an era where large amounts of text can be copied, paraphrased, or fabricated with ease, determining the true author of a text is crucial for maintaining trust in communication. 
Scenarios include detecting plagiarised passages of texts~\citep{stein_intrinsic_2011}, and verifying the authenticity of online content or student submissions. 
Formally, we refer to these problems as \acf{av} or \acf{aa}, where every \ac{aa} task can be formulated as a sequence of \ac{av} problems~\citep{tyo_state_2022,barlas_cross_domain_2020}.

The emergence of \acp{llm} adds an additional layer of complexity. 
While these models are widely embraced for beneficial applications such as summarisation, information seeking, and assistive writing~\citep{wang_stumbling_2024}, their ability to convincingly imitate human writing creates new risks. 
\acp{llm} can be used to generate misinformation, impair academic honesty, or impersonate individuals, thereby inflicting harm on individuals who fall victim to these schemes~\citep{mitchell_detectgpt_2023,li_learning_2025,wang_stumbling_2024,bhattacharjee_fighting_2024}. 
Since \acp{llm} can be conceptualised as authors, their detection naturally falls within the scope of \ac{av}. 
Thus, instead of treating \ac{llm} detection as an isolated task, it is more consistent to frame it as a specialised case of \ac{av}~\citep{llm_detection_av_2025}.

% specificity rather than generality
Existing approaches to generalisation typically train a single model and apply it across domains.
Despite significant advances in \ac{av}, prior work finds that such models struggle in \ac{ood} settings, where the topic or genre diverges from the training data~\citep{Sundararajan_style_18,bischoff_importance_2020,li_learning_2025}. 
This shortcoming motivates a shift towards scenario-specific solutions, i.e.\ models are trained anew for narrowly defined cases. 
Such single-case approaches enable more precise control over contextual factors and place greater emphasis on stylistic idiosyncrasies rather than domain-level variation.

% AV
The \impAppr{} by \citet{koppel_determining_2014}\ introduces the idea of generating \imp{} texts, i.e.\ hard negatives, used to sharpen the discrimination between genuine and false authorship matches. 
However, the method's effectiveness is limited by the quality and contextual adequacy of these \imp{} texts. 
Previous work did not fully address how to construct challenging \imps{} via controlled contextual variables.

The thesis extends the \impAppr{} by leveraging \acl{sota} \acp{llm} to generate paraphrases as \imps{}, enabling control over multiple confounding factors such as genre, topic, and target audience. 
In doing so, the approach shifts the focus towards authorial style rather than domain differences, yielding improved precision–recall on the \dataStudent{} dataset compared with the original sampling strategies, \unmasking{} and \acs{ppmd}.
