% specificity rather than generality
Due to the diversity of text domains (/topics), we believe that generalized solutions for \ac{llm} detection are not feasible.
Generalized solutions refer to models that are trained once on a dataset and then used for all texts.

Literature suggests that many models fail to detect all \acp{llm} especially in \ac{ood} scenarios~\cite{bhattacharjee_fighting_2024,li_learning_2025}.

% frame problem
We focus on single case solutions, i.e. models trained tailored to a specific scenario.
Formally, single case solutions include creating \ac{id} \ac{llm} detection scenarios, 
where we can control all variables (train new model for each dataset).
