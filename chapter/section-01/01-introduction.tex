\section{Research Questions}
\label{sec:research_questions}
To guide this objective, we formulate the following research questions:
\begin{questions}
    \item \textbf{What is the suitability of \acp{llm} for \imp{} generation?} \label{enum:rq1} \hfill \\
    Optimal \imps{} function as hard negatives in \ac{av}.
    By generating paraphrases with \acp{llm} that control genre, topic, and other contextual factors, similarity measures in the \imp{} method primarily emphasize differences in authorial style rather than content.
    However, the threshold of syntactic similarity at which paraphrases are attributed to the candidate author remains unclear, potentially reducing detection accuracy.
    We design an experiment comparing simple one-step and advanced two-step \ac{llm} paraphrasing techniques against traditional baselines using standard classification metrics.
    Additionally, we analyse how syntactic similarity between the candidate reference and \ac{llm}-generated paraphrases affects detection performance.
    % We obtain this controlled environment by utilizing \acp{llm} to paraphrase the original text.
    % There are different approaches to paraphrasing text using \acp{llm}.
    % They include (a) directly asking the \ac{llm} to paraphrase the text, 
    % (b) first extracting specific information from the original text and subsequently generating a paraphrase based on the information.
    % This thesis compares both approaches on \dataStudent{}, \dataBlog{}, \dataGutenberg{} and \dataPan{}.

    \item \textbf{Which metrics are appropriate to evaluate the quality of generated \imps{}?} \label{enum:rq2} \hfill \\
    Optimal \imps{} are generated under the same constraints as the candidate text.
    We use \ac{llm}-generated paraphrases as a heuristic of the original generation process.
    Thus, evaluating \imps{} equates to evaluating paraphrases, a task complicated by the lack of a universal definition of paraphrasing.
    Previous studies often adapt metrics from related \ac{nlp} tasks such as machine translation and summarization.
    Two primary evaluation dimensions are semantic similarity and syntactic similarity.
    Contrary to initial assumptions, high syntactic similarity is not always desirable, as it may indicate minimal modification of the original text.
    Our emphasis is on achieving high semantic similarity while preserving syntactic diversity to ensure genuine rephrasing.
    Moreover, relatively low scores can be acceptable if qualitative human assessments confirm paraphrase adequacy.
    We construct an experiment to compare both our prompts and paraphrasers in terms of state-of-the-art paraphrasing measures. 

    % \item \textbf{Which features are used for the \ac{av} problem?} \label{enum:rq3} \hfill \\
    % Traditional features include character tri-gram features, while newer research has proposed using \ac{llm} such as BERT.

    \item \textbf{How does the \ac{llm}-based \impAppr{} perform compared to established \ac{av} methods?} \label{enum:rq3} \hfill \\
    We use Unmasking and PPMD as baselines to evaluate our \ac{llm}-based \impAppr{}.
    Although computationally intensive, our method is designed as a solution tailored to specific detection tasks  rather than a general-purpose \ac{llm} detection tool.
    Performance is assessed across three scenarios: (a) human-human input pairs,
    (b) pairs using at least one \ac{llm}, and (c) \ac{llm}-\ac{llm} pairs.
    We test \ac{av} and \ac{llm} detection scenario.
    Comparisons are conducted on the \dataStudent{} dataset using standard classification metrics.
    
\end{questions}

% \section*{Idea}
% \label{sec:idea}

% Given a text of unknown authorship (i.e., human or \ac{llm}), 
% construct a set of \imp{} texts using state-of-the-art \acp{llm} based on the original text.
% Obtain the author by \ac{aa}/ \ac{av} methods, such as unmasking, to \textit{confidently}, i.e. high precision, identify \ac{llm} generated texts
% (and possibly which \ac{llm}).



\section{Contributions}
\label{sec:contributions}
The main contributions of this thesis are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item We reimplemented the traditional \imp{} method~\citep{koppel_determining_2014} (cf. \autoref{sec:impostor_method_theory}).
    \item Our work includes developing an implementation of \ac{llm}-based \imp{} generation (cf. \autoref{chap:llm_impostor_method}). 
    \item To evaluate the use of \acp{llm} for generating hard negative \imps{}, we conducted an empirical assessment focusing on (a) the influence of syntactic similarity between the reference candidate and the paraphrase, and (b) performance relative to traditional \imp{} generation techniques proposed by \citet{koppel_determining_2014} (cf. \autoref{chap:experimental_results}/ \ref{enum:rq1})
    \item We compared paraphrasing approaches quantitatively using standard summarization and translation-based techniques (cf. \autoref{chap:experimental_results}/ \ref{enum:rq2})
    \item The proposed \ac{llm}-based \imp{} method was evaluated against established \ac{av} techniques, namely Unmasking and PPMD (cf. \autoref{chap:experimental_results}/ \ref{enum:rq3})
    \item We analysed how chunked paraphrases affect detector scores by varying the number of chunks and assessing detection performance (cf. \autoref{chap:experimental_results}).
    \item We collected and preprocessed the original datasets, including a deliberate candidate-pair selection procedure aligned with the methodology of the original study by \citet{koppel_determining_2014}, informed through direct consultation with the original authors (cf. \autoref{sec:dataset}).
