\section{Research Questions}
\label{sec:research_questions}
To address the overarching objective of this thesis, we formulate the following research questions:
\begin{questions}
    \item \textbf{How suitable are \acp{llm} for \imp{} generation?} \label{enum:rq1} \hfill \\
    Effective \imps{}, i.e. hard negatives, must be generated under constraints comparable to those of the candidate text. 
    We employ \ac{llm}-based paraphrasing as a proxy for the original generative process. 
    By conditioning \acp{llm} on genre, topic, and other contextual parameters, the \imp{} method emphasizes differences in authorial style rather than in content. 
    However, the precise syntactic similarity threshold at which paraphrases are attributable to the candidate author remains uncertain, potentially limiting detection accuracy. 
    To investigate the suitability of artificial \imp{} generation, we design an experiment that contrasts one-step \imp{} generation with traditional baselines using standard classification metrics.

    \item \textbf{Which metrics are appropriate to evaluate the quality of generated \imps{}?} \label{enum:rq2} \hfill \\
    Assessing \imps{} requires evaluating paraphrases, a task complicated by the absence of a universally accepted definition of paraphrasing. 
    Prior work often adopts evaluation metrics from adjacent \ac{nlp} tasks such as machine translation and summarization. 
    The two central dimensions are semantic similarity and syntactic similarity. 
    Contrary to naive assumptions, high syntactic similarity is not always desirable, as it may indicate minimal modification of the original text.
    Instead, the objective is to achieve strong semantic alignment while ensuring sufficient syntactic variation to capture genuine rephrasing. 
    Furthermore, relatively low automatic scores may still be acceptable if supported by human judgments of adequacy. 
    We therefore construct experiments to evaluate paraphrases using \acl{sota} measures for paraphrase quality. 

    \item \textbf{How does the \ac{llm}-based \impAppr{} perform compared to \acl{sota} \ac{av} methods?} \label{enum:rq3} \hfill \\
    To benchmark our approach, we compare it against established baselines introduced by \citet{koppel_determining_2014}.
    % , \textcolor{red}{as well as \unmasking{} and compression-based \ac{ppmd}}. 
    The evaluation is conducted on human-authored text pairs from the \dataStudent{} dataset, applying standard classification metrics.

\section{Contributions}

The main contributions of this thesis are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Collection and preprocessing of original datasets, including a controlled candidate-pair selection procedure aligned with the methodology of \citet{koppel_determining_2014} and informed by direct consultation with the authors (cf.~\autoref{sec:dataset}).
    \item Reimplementation of the traditional \impAppr{}~\citep{koppel_determining_2014}\ (cf.~\autoref{sec:impostor_method_theory}).
    \item Development of an \ac{llm}-based \impAppr{} extending the work by \citet{koppel_determining_2014} (cf.~\autoref{sec:impostor_generation}). 
    % \item Empirical evaluation of \ac{llm}-generated hard negatives, with a focus on prompts influencing the control of confounder variables during the artificial \imp{} generation process (cf.~\autoref{subsec:prompt_impact_res}/~\ref{enum:rq1}).
    \item Analysis of prompt design and its influence on paraphrase length as a confounding variable (cf.~\autoref{subsec:prompt_impact_res}/~\ref{enum:rq1} and \ref{enum:rq2}).
    \item Quantitative comparison of paraphrasing approaches using metrics adapted from summarization and translation tasks (hereafter paraphrasing scores) (cf.~\autoref{sec:comp_paraphrases}/~\ref{enum:rq2}).
    \item Analysis of the effect of text segmentation (i.e. number of chunks) on paraphrasing scores (cf.~\autoref{sec:results_chunks}/~\ref{enum:rq2}).
    \item Evaluation of the proposed \ac{llm}-based \impAppr{} against established \ac{av} techniques, specifically the baselines introduced by \citet{koppel_determining_2014}
    % , \textcolor{red}{\unmasking{} and \ac{ppmd}},
