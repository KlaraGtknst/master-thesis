\subsection{Exp. 5: Comparing traditional to \ac{llm}-based \imps{}}
\label{subsec:imp_gen}

We evaluated the performance of traditional impostor generation~\citep{koppel_determining_2014}, against \ac{llm}-based impostor generation on the \dataBlog{} and \dataStudent{} datasets. 
For each dataset, \textcolor{red}{one} sample was selected from both the training and test splits. 
The detector configuration is shown in Table~\ref{tab:imp_gen_comp}.

\begin{tabular}{@{}rlrrl@{}}   % numbers should be right aligned, text left aligned
\toprule
\# Impostors & Generation & Rounds & Top $n$ & Upsample \\
\midrule
50 & \textit{Variable} & 100 & \num{100000} & False \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}%
\end{table}

For each impostor generation method, we computed accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score for different thresholds.
