\subsection{Comparing \ac{av} Methods}

This experiment evaluates the performance of the \impAppr{} in comparison to established \ac{av} methods.
As baselines, we employ generalized unmasking~\citep{bevendorff_generalizing_2019} and the compression-based approach PPMD approach.
All methods share the common characteristic of operating on lower-dimensional representations of the input text pair to determine whether both texts originate from the same author.

Following the experimental setup described in \autoref{subsec:imp_gen}, we assess performance using  accuracy, precision, recall, and the F1 score.
