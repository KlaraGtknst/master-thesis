\subsection{Exp. 6: Comparing \ac{av} Methods in different scenarios}

This experiment evaluates the performance of the \impAppr{} in comparison to established \ac{av} methods.
As baselines, we employ generalized unmasking~\citep{bevendorff_generalizing_2019} and the compression-based approach PPMD approach and baselines from the original work~\citep{koppel_determining_2014}.

Following the experimental setup described in \autoref{tab:av_comp}, we assess performance using  accuracy, precision, recall, and the F1 score.
