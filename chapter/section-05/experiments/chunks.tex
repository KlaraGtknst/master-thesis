\subsection{Exp.\ 3: Paraphrasing Chunks}
\label{subsec:paraphrasing_chunks}

We designed this experiment to evaluate whether chunk-to-chunk paraphrases exhibit better control than text-to-text paraphrases, since chunks contain fewer topic changes than whole texts in theory.
We use one text from the \dataBlog{}, \dataGutenberg{}, and the \dataStudent{} dataset, respectively.

  \caption[Paraphrase configuration hyperparameters.]{Breakdown of individual hyperparameters in the paraphrase configuration.
  We use one document per dataset, chunked into one to five sections and paraphrased with all nine paraphrasers in two variance inducing settings (i.e.\ prompt for one-step, temperature for two-step).
  This amounts to a total of 936 API calls. 
  }
  \label{fig:chunks_api_calls}
\end{figure}


First, texts are chunked preserving sentences.
Chunks are filled with sentences in sentence order such that each chunk roughly contains the same number of words.
Second, paraphrase configurations are defined.
Each one-step paraphraser is paired with two prompts, while each two-step paraphraser is paired with two temperatures.
Third, each chunk is paraphrased with all configurations.
These steps account for a minimum of 936 API calls for paraphrasing.
Each component of the configuration is displayed in \autoref{fig:chunks_api_calls}.
Finally, for each paraphrase, we compute BLEU, ROUGE1, ROUGE2, ROUGEL, ROUGELsum, METEOR, BERTScore Precision, BERTScore Recall, BERTScore F1, SBERT \ac{wms}, SBERT cosine similarity.
Scores for chunks of a text are averaged per configuration to obtain the final score for a text, number of chunks, configuration triple.
The adequate formula is given in \autoref{eq:avg_chunks} and an example is illustrated in \autoref{fig:mean-bleu}.

\begin{equation}
    score(t) = \frac{1}{\#\text{ chunks}}\sum_{i=1}^{\#\text{ chunks}}score(c_i)\text{, for chunk }c_i \in \text{text }t
\label{eq:avg_chunks}
\end{equation}
