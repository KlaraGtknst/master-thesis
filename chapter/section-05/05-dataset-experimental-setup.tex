\chapter{Experimental Setup}
\label{chap:experimental_setup}

In the following, we will outline the experimental setup for the experiments we ran.
This includes not only allocation, preprocessing and pair selection of each dataset, but also a description and motivation of the experiments carried out.

The following experiments are designed to systematically evaluate the extension of the \impAppr{}~\citep{koppel_determining_2014} with \ac{llm} generated impostors. 

We begin by reproducing the original experiments by \citet{koppel_determining_2014} to ensure comparability between our implementation and previously reported results. 
Next, we investigate the quality of paraphrases used in \imp{} generation. 
In particular, we compare our one-step paraphrasing strategy with our two-step approach based on the paraphrasing measures from \autoref{subsec:traditional_quantitative_evaluation_measures}. 
Then, we evaluate paraphrase quality across different numbers of text chunks.
We then analyse the effect of syntactic similarity between paraphrases and original texts on \imp{} scores. 
Then, we compare different \ac{av} methods including the \impAppr{} with several strategies for \imp{} generation for varying sources of input text pairs. 
This allows us to examine the relative strengths of different \ac{av} approaches for specific \ac{av} tasks.
