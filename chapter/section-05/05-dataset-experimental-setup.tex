\chapter{Experimental Setup}
\label{chap:experimental_setup}

In the following, we will outline the experimental setup for the experiments we ran.
This includes not only allocation, preprocessing and pair selection of each dataset, but also a description and motivation for the experiments carried out.

The following experiments are designed to systematically evaluate the extension of the \impAppr{}~\citep{koppel_determining_2014} with \ac{llm} generated impostors. 

We begin by reproducing the original experiments by \citet{koppel_determining_2014}\ to ensure comparability between our implementation and previously reported results. 
Next, we investigate the quality of paraphrases used for \imp{} generation. 
In particular, we compare our one-step paraphrasing strategy with our two-step approach based on the paraphrasing measures from \autoref{sec:evaluation_measures}. 
Then, we evaluate paraphrase quality across different numbers of text chunks.
We then analyse the effect of \textcolor{red}{syntactic similarity between paraphrases and the input texts on the \impAppr{} effectiveness}. 
Then, we compare different \acl{sota} \ac{av} methods with the \impAppr{} applying several strategies across \imp{} generation for varying sources of input text pairs. 
This allows us to examine the relative strengths of different \ac{av} approaches for specific \ac{av} tasks.
