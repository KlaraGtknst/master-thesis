\chapter{Experimental Setup}
\label{chap:experimental_setup}

In the following, we outline the experimental setup for the experiments we ran.
This includes not only allocation, preprocessing and pair selection of each dataset, but also a description and motivation for the experiments carried out.

We designed the following experiments to systematically evaluate the extension of the original \impAppr{} by \citet{koppel_determining_2014} with \ac{llm} generated impostors. 

We begin by reproducing the experiments of \citet{koppel_determining_2014} to establish comparability between our implementation and prior results.
Subsequently, we examine the quality of paraphrases generated by different paraphrasers, comparing a one-step strategy with a two-step approach using the evaluation measures described in \autoref{sec:evaluation_measures}.
We then analyse paraphrase quality for different numbers of chunks (i.e. text segmentation) in both the one- and two-step setting and for different prompts in the one-step setting.
Finally, we compare multiple \ac{av} methods with variants of the \impAppr{} that employ different \imp{} generation strategies, evaluating them in the traditional \ac{av} scenario with human-authored text pairs.
