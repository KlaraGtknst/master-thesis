\section{Evaluation Measures}
\label{sec:evaluation_measures}

In the following sections, we review state-of-the-art quantitative evaluation metrics for \ac{av} in \Cref{subsec:av_quality_measures} and for paraphrase generation in \Cref{subsec:paraphrase_evaluation}.
While human judgment is subjective, quantitive metrics are designed to be comparable and reproducible, providing a more objective basis for evaluation.
