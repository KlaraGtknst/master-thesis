\section{Exp. 5: Comparing \acs{av} methods in traditional Human-Human scenario}

We want to answer the question of how our \ac{llm}-based \imp{} generation performs compared to (a) traditional \imp{} generation in the \impAppr{} and compared to (b) \ac{sota} \ac{av} methods in the traditional \ac{av} scenario.
We thus, create same- and different-author pairs from the \dataStudent{} dataset and evaluate the performance of the approaches for different thresholds.
It is noteworthy, that the dataset contains equally many naive same- and different-author pairs and hence, an approach predicting only one output will obtain an accuracy of $0.5$.

  \caption{Accuracy curves for the class same-author across different threshold on \dataStudent{} dataset without \ac{llm} candidates. We find that \ac{llm} based approaches perform slightly above chance and better than the rest. For high thresholds, recall is not as high and thus, this approach seems not to be as bad as in other scenarios.

Baseline Mirror minds performs reasonable well compared to the other approaches due to its high recall.
You may find the recall curves across different threshold attached in the Appendix in \autoref{sec:app_detection_scenarios}.
Paraphrases are single words, which prompt the discriminator to always predict same-author since any candidate text contains more stylistic similarity than the single-word \imps{}.
We find this approach produces many \acp{fp}.


Since half of the test dataset contains different author pairs, thresholds bigger than $0.55$ enviably lead to the minimal accuracy possible of $0.5$.
