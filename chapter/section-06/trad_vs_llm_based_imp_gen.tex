\section{Exp.\ 5: Comparing \acs{av} Methods in Traditional Human-Human Scenario}
\label{sec:results_trad_av}


This experiment investigates how our \ac{llm}-based \imp{} generation performs relative to (a) traditional \imp{} generation within the \impAppr{}, and (b) state-of-the-art \ac{av} methods in a conventional human-human \ac{av} scenario. 
To this end, we construct \textcolor{orange}{10} same-author and \textcolor{orange}{10} different-author pairs from the \dataStudent{} dataset and evaluate the approaches across varying thresholds.

The \mirrorMinds{} approach assigns nearly every input pair to the same-author class, yielding a precision of approximately $0.5$. 
This behaviour is due to the nature of its paraphrases, which consist of single words. 
The discriminator interprets any candidate text as stylistically more similar than \mirrorMinds{}' minimal \imps{}, leading to a bias towards same-author predictions. 
In contrast, naive \ac{llm}-based \imp{} generation achieves the highest $F_1$ scores, although its precision remains between $0.6$ and $0.7$. 
This suggests that the generated \imps{} are still relatively easy, producing \acp{fp} in some cases.

$F_1$ scores generally decline for most approaches as the threshold increases. 
\ac{llm}-based methods maintain relatively stable effectiveness across thresholds due to consistently high recall values. 

Among the original baselines~\citep{koppel_determining_2014}, the fixed \imp{} generation performs best, with its text-length-informed variant showing slightly improved results. 
Both approaches exhibit high precision but low recall. 
The length-based \imp{} generation consistently achieves higher recall than the fixed variant. 
Incorporating content similarity into \imp{} selection does not significantly affect effectiveness, as both content-based and fixed \imp{} approaches yield similar outcomes. 
Recall curves across thresholds are provided in the Appendix (cf.~\Cref{sec:app_detection_scenarios}).
