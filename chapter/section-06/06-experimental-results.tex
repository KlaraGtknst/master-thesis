\chapter{Experimental Results}
\label{chap:experimental_results}

This chapter presents the results of the experimental evaluation of our work. 
We begin by reproducing traditional results to establish the validity of our approach, followed by a comparison of different paraphrasing techniques. 
Subsequently, we analyse paraphrase quality across varying text chunk sizes and prompts, and compare traditional \ac{av} methods with the extended \impAppr{}.
