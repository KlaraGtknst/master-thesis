\chapter{Experimental Results}
\label{chap:experimental_results}

This chapter presents the results of the experimental evaluation of our work. 
We begin by reproducing traditional results to establish the validity of our approach, followed by a comparison of different paraphrasing techniques. 
Subsequently, we analyse paraphrase quality across varying text chunk sizes, \textcolor{orange}{examine the impact of syntactic similarity between paraphrases} and input texts on detector effectiveness, and contrast traditional \ac{av} methods with the extended \impAppr{}. 
Finally, we explore results across diverse application scenarios to highlight the strengths and limitations of our method.
