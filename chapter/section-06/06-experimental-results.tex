\chapter{Experimental Results}
\label{chap:experimental_results}

This chapter presents the results of the experimental evaluation of our work. 
We begin by reproducing traditional results to establish the validity of our approach, followed by a comparison of different paraphrasing techniques. 
Subsequently, we analyse performance across varying text chunk sizes, examine the impact of syntactic similarity between paraphrases and reference candidates on detector performance, and contrast traditional methods with \ac{llm}-based \imp{} generation. 
Finally, we explore results across diverse application scenarios to highlight the strengths and limitations of our method.
