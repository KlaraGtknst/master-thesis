\section{Exp.\ 1: Reproduction of Original Work}

Our first experiment covers the reproduction of the original results~\citep{koppel_determining_2014}.
It is noteworthy, that we do not expect exact replication since we could only reimplement the approach to our best knowledge.
Both Mr. Koppel and Mr. Winter were very forthcoming when we contacted them regarding implementation details that could help to improve our implementation.
Unfortunately, the code was no longer traceable and neither author could recall the preprocessing steps.
After consultation with Mr. Winter, he assured that our preprocessing steps seem reasonable.
This, however, certainly is one of the reasons why our implementation diverges from the original work.

\paragraph{Exp.\ 1(a): Varying number of \imps{}.}

For this experiment, we generate \imps{} using the \texttt{fixed} method while varying only the number of \imps{}.
\citet{koppel_determining_2014}\ report results of this experiment exclusively on the \dataBlog{} dataset.
% While we compare their findings with ours, it is important to note that direct comparability is limited due to differences in the underlying datasets, as our results are based on the \dataStudent{} corpus.
While we compare their findings with ours, it is important to note that direct comparability is limited since the maximum number of \imps{} we tested is \num{1000} instead of \num{5000} due to time constraints.
In contrast to the original study, our \impAppr{} recall–precision curves intersect, suggesting that the results reported by \citet{koppel_determining_2014}\ exhibit stronger separation.
% In our experiments, the number of \imps{} exerts minimal influence on precision and recall for the \dataStudent{} dataset.
% Nevertheless, similar to the original findings, we observe that using 50 \imps{} yields marginally superior performance.
Opposed to the original results, the best results are obtained using 500 \imps{} instead of 50.
While we match one original recall-precision pair reported for 50 \imps{}, our results for 500 \imps{} differ from the recall-precision pair reported by \citet{koppel_determining_2014}.
Although on another dataset, our findings on the \dataStudent{} dataset in \autoref{app:exp_student_dif_n} suggest that 50 \imps{} perform best like the original findings.

\paragraph{Exp.\ 1(b): Varying \imp{} generation.}

Adhering to \citet{koppel_determining_2014}, we compare multiple \ac{av} methods with variants of the \impAppr{} that employ different \imp{} generation strategies, evaluating them in the \ac{av} scenario with human-authored text pairs.
The \imp{} generation strategies include sampling from a \texttt{fixed} set of potential \imp{} candidates, and \texttt{on-the-fly} \imp{} generation. 
The baselines introduced by \citet{koppel_determining_2014} are \ac{svm}, and unsupervised similarity based approaches.
Each class is treated as the positive (i.e. reference) class once, with the other class serving as the negative class. 
This choice affects how the evaluation scores are computed, but not how the thresholds are fit during the training.
Although not explicitly stated, it is likely that \citet{koppel_determining_2014} have trained each approach for both reference class scenarios once.
The original work reports the results for the \dataBlog{} dataset only.

% original results
The recall–precision curves reported by \citet{koppel_determining_2014}\ indicate that \texttt{fixed} \imp{} generation outperforms \texttt{on-the-fly} \imp{} generation.
In their study, the minimum recall values for the different-author class were consistently higher (approximately $0.625$ for \texttt{fixed} and $0.58$ for \texttt{on-the-fly}) than for the same-author class (approximately $0.38$ for \texttt{fixed} and $0.22$ for \texttt{on-the-fly}).
In contrast, precision values exhibited the opposite trend where all approaches achieved higher precision in the same-author setting compared to the different-author setting.

Our interpretation of the results reported by \citet{koppel_determining_2014}\ is presented in \autoref{fig:findings_original_work}.
We argue that these findings are a consequence of the nature of \ac{av} as an open-set, one-class classification problem.
Because the different-author class lacks representative samples, it remains inherently ill-defined.
As a consequence, both \imp{} generation methods tend to yield more different-author predictions than same-author predictions, producing higher recall for the different-author class and higher precision for the same-author class.

    \label{fig:findings_original_work}
\end{figure}

% our results
Both \citet{koppel_determining_2014}\ and our results indicate that \texttt{fixed} \imp{} generation performs best in the same-author scenario.
Beyond this agreement, however, our recall–precision curves deviate from the original findings.
In the different-author scenario, all methods except \texttt{on-the-fly} generation exhibit low precision, with \texttt{fixed} \imps{} performing worst.
Low precision corresponds to a high number of \acp{fp}, i.e., many same-author pairs incorrectly classified as different authors.
This outcome suggests that training on the same-author class produces systematically poor performance in a different-author class test scenario, as the model is not optimized for it.

Opposed to the original work of \citet{koppel_determining_2014}, our \texttt{on-the-fly} \imps{} lack difficulty explaining the low precision in the same-author and the high precision in the different-author scenario.
Since we had to reduce the number of test samples for \texttt{on-the-fly} \imp{} generation due to API call limits, we suggest analysing this approaches' results with a grain of salt.
However, Mr. Winter noted that our \texttt{on-the-fly} \imp{} generation implementation seems insufficient, due to the rise of bot prevention blocking web scraping and the very limited number of API calls per month.
