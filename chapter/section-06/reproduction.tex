\section{Exp. 1: Reproduction of Original Work}

Our first experiment covers the reproduction of the original results attached in \citet{koppel_determining_2014}'s paper.
It is noteworthy, that we do not expect exact replication since we could only reimplement the approach to our best knowledge.
Both Mr. Koppel and Mr. Winter were very forthcoming when we contacted them regarding implementation details that could help to improve our implementation.
Unfortunately, the code was no longer traceable and neither author could recall exactly what preprocessing steps included.
After consultation with Mr. Winter, he assured that our preprocessing steps seem reasonable.
This, however, certainly is one of the reasons why our implementation diverges from the original work.

\paragraph{Exp. 1(a): Varying number of \imps{}}

For this experiment, we set the \imp{} generation method to \texttt{fix} and varied only the number of \imps{}.
We only have reference results of this experiment on \dataBlog{} from the original paper.
Fortunately, though the form of the original precision-recall plot slightly differs, we obtain the same result:
In terms of recall, 50 \imps{} achieve the best results.

\paragraph{Exp. 1(b): Varying \imp{} generation}

Adhereing to \citet{koppel_determining_2014}, we compare the \impAppr{} for fixed, and on-th-fly \imp{} generation with \ac{svc}, and similarity based baselines.
They consider both the same-author and the different-authors class the reference class once.
The original work included only the results for the \dataBlog{} dataset.

  \caption{Recall-precision curves for the class same-author. Due to API limit restrictions, the test set for on-the-fly was smaller which is visible in the respective curves.}
  \label{fig:same_authors}
\end{figure}

For the same-author reference class, both \citet{koppel_determining_2014} and us find that the fixed \imp{} generation approach generally performs best across different threshold.
While in the original work, the \ac{svc} baseline performed best from the three baselines, we find the opposite to be true.
Generally, our results perform worse than the original. 
While \citet{koppel_determining_2014} obtain precision higher than $0.9$ for recall values up to $0.7$, we drop to sub $0.8$ precision fairly quickly.
Except for the on-the-fly results, the overall form resembles the original work roughly.

  \caption{Recall-precision curves for the class different-author. Due to API limit restrictions, the test set for on-the-fly was smaller which is visible in the respective curves.}
  \label{fig:different_authors}
\end{figure}

For different authors as reference class, our results greatly differ from the original work.
Even though, \citet{koppel_determining_2014}'s precision scores for fixed and on-the-fly \imp{} generation are generally lower than those for the same-author reference class, our scores are way lower.
Notably, in our case, the on-the-fly method seems to perform best in this open-set scenario.
