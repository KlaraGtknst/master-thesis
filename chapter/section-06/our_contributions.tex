\subsection{Exp.\ 5: Comparing \acs{av} Methods in Traditional Human-Human Scenario}
\label{subsec:imp_gen_res}

We evaluate precision–recall values across varying thresholds for the baseline methods as well as for the fixed approach introduced by \citet{koppel_determining_2014}.
Our results indicate that the supervised baseline and our one-step paraphrasing approach (Naive \ac{llm} in \autoref{fig:sem_syn_blog}) produce identical outcomes.
An examination of the individual values confirms this observation, revealing identical precision–recall pairs where respective thresholds are different.
We attribute this effect to the relatively small sample size of only \textcolor{red}{10} text pairs.

With respect to optimizing the precision–recall trade-off, the supervised baseline and our \ac{llm}-based extension of the \impAppr{} achieve the most favorable performance at a threshold of $0.075$, and $0.32$ respectively.
When precision is prioritized over recall, however, all remaining methods outperform these two approaches, as they achieve higher recall while maintaining the same maximum precision.
Although the definition of an optimal balance between precision and recall is application-dependent, we argue that a recall of $0.4$ at perfect precision is generally less informative than jointly optimizing both metrics.

Overall, these findings diverge from our initial expectation that \ac{llm}-based \imp{} generation would yield superior precision.
