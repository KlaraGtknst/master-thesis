\section{Exp. 6: Comparing \acs{av} Methods in \acs{llm} Author Scenarios}
\label{sec:results_llm_av}

This experiment evaluates the performance of the \impAppr{} against established \ac{av} methods on the \dataArtificialStudent{} dataset where each input pair contains at least one \ac{llm}-generated text.  
The baseline \mirrorMinds{} performs comparatively well due to its consistently high recall.  
The recall curves across different thresholds and scenarios can be found in the Appendix in \autoref{sec:app_detection_scenarios}.  
However, \mirrorMinds{}' strength is a misconception due to its oversimplified paraphrases, which consist of single words.  
This triviality biases the discriminator toward predicting same-author, since any candidate text necessarily contains more stylistic information than the single-word \imps{}.  
As a result, this method produces a large number of \acp{fp}.


\paragraph{\ac{llm} detection}

In the \ac{llm} detection setting, the traditional baselines PPMD, Unmasking, and the supervised \ac{svm} perform best in terms of precision.  
Nevertheless, it becomes evident that no method achieves a favourable balance between high precision or high recall since none can attain both simultaneously.  

Among the \imp{}-based approaches, random sampling variants (content, text length, and fixed) outperform naive \ac{llm}-based \imps{}, although their absolute performance remains unsatisfactory.  
\mirrorMinds{} and naive \ac{llm} \imps{} are overly simplistic, leading to consistently low precision and inflated recall, since the majority of input pairs are incorrectly classified as same-author.  
Consequently, these approaches are particularly ill-suited for detecting \acp{llm}.

\paragraph{General \ac{llm} \ac{av}}

Contrary to initial intuition, neither \mirrorMinds{} nor naive \ac{llm} approaches are suitable for this task, as their high recall results in excessive \acp{fp} and low precision.  
Although PPMD and Unmasking achieve relatively high precision, their recall is consistently low, yielding poor overall $F_1$ performance.  
Both methods predominantly predict different-author, thereby underestimating same-author cases.  

The best-performing baseline is the supervised model, which reaches a maximum precision of approximately $0.7$ for recall $\leq 0.55$.  
However, overall performance remains unsatisfactory across all methods, particularly in terms of precision, which hovers slightly above $0.2$.

\paragraph{\ac{llm}-\ac{llm} \ac{av}}

Overall $F_1$ scores for \ac{av} in the \ac{llm}-\ac{llm} scenario are higher than in the general \ac{llm} \ac{av} setting, suggesting that the presence of human-authored texts complicates attribution.  

At first glance, \mirrorMinds{} appears to perform best. 
However, this impression is misleading.  
Its trivial \imps{} inflate recall without offering genuine discriminative power.  
Interestingly, the Unmasking baseline exhibits similar recall behaviour for thresholds below $0.4$.  

Fixed, content-based, and text-length-driven \imp{} generation methods achieve precision between $0.4$ and $0.7$, yet their $F_1$ scores remain low due to poor recall, i.e. most pairs are incorrectly assigned to the different-author class.  
Similarly, PPMD and the unsupervised min-max approach yield high precision but equally low recall, again resulting in poor $F_1$ values.  

The overall best-performing approach is naive \ac{llm} generation, which maintains a precision of approximately $0.6$ across thresholds.  
However, with increasing threshold its recall decreases monotonically indicating both \acp{tp} and \acp{fp} are discarded in roughly equal measure, implying that the generated \imps{} fail to meaningfully distinguish between same- and different-author pairs.
