\section{Exp. 3: Paraphrasing Chunks}

Initially, we hypothesized that smaller chunks of text would lead to better paraphrases, since smaller chunks are easer to process and control in terms of topic, suggesting that the separation of text into smaller chunks would be beneficial for the paraphrasing process.
We therefore designed an experiment to test this hypothesis.
We computed several paraphrasing measurements for the same input texts averaged over the number of chunks.
As visualized in \autoref{fig:abl_chunks_gpt_oss}, \autoref{fig:abl_chunks_Translation} and \autoref{fig:abl_chunks_BulletPoint},
the scores of paraphrasers are influenced by the number of text chunks.
Since chunking produces computational overhead increasing time spent and API calls used, we will not use chunks for the paraphrasing process but rather stick to text-to-text paraphrases.
