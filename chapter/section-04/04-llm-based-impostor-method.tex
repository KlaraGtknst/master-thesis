\chapter{\acs{llm}-based \Imp{} Method}
\label{chap:llm_impostor_method}

A central challenge in \ai{} is the presence of confounding factors such as register, genre, topic, and target audience. 
These dimensions restrict linguistic options, thereby obscuring the stylometric features relevant for authorship-related tasks. 
To address this issue, we propose an extension of the \impAppr{} originally proposed by \citet{koppel_determining_2014} that leverages \acp{llm} to systematically control for such confounders. 
By generating texts under carefully constrained conditions, we obtain \imps{} that preserve the semantic content of the original reference text while capturing the \ac{llm}'s authorial style, thereby serving as controlled proxies for modeling the actual generation process of the reference text.
