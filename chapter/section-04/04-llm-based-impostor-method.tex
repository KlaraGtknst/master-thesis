\chapter{\acs{llm}-based \Imp{} Method}
\label{chap:llm_impostor_method}

A central challenge in authorship analysis is the presence of confounding factors such as register, genre, topic, and target audience. 
These dimensions restrict linguistic options, thereby obscuring the stylometric features relevant for authorship-related tasks. 
To address this issue, we propose an extension of the \impAppr{} originally proposed by \citet{koppel_determining_2014} that leverages \acp{llm} to systematically control for such confounders. 
By generating texts under carefully constrained conditions, we obtain \imps{} that preserve the semantic content of the original reference text while capturing the \ac{llm}'s authorial style, thereby serving as controlled proxies for modeling the actual generation process of the reference text.
