\section{Imposter dataset}
\label{sec:imposter_dataset}

\citet{koppel_determining_2014} construct a corpus of 500 documents pairs $<X,Y>$ of blog posts.
Half of them are by the same author, half by different authors.
No single author is represented more than once.
The task is to determine whether the two documents are by the same author.
Since the model is not supplied any labelled samples of any author, the method is considered unsupervised.
