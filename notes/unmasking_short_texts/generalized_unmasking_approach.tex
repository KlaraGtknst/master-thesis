\section{Generalized Unmasking Approach}
\label{sec:generalized_unmasking_approach}

\citet{bevendorff_generalizing_2019} prioritize precision, 
i.e. high confidence verification of authorship and thus, rejecting low confidence predictions.
They propose an \todo{open-source, customizable unmasking framework}. % cf. bevendorff_generalizing_2019 for url

\citet{bevendorff_generalizing_2019} propose creating chunks by oversampling words in a bootstrap aggregating manner, 
Each text is a pool of words, from which words are sampled without replacement.
The pool is replenished if it is exhausted before the chunk has sufficiently many words.
Since the random sampling of unmasking features introduces variance, unmasking is performed multiple times and the curves are averaged.
The algorithm is displayed in \autoref{alg:generalized_unmasking}.

% prediction
Another linear \ac{svm} classifier is trained on the accuracy curve, its central-difference gradients (first- and second order), and its gradients sorted by magnitude.
This classifier is used to predict the whether the texts originate from the same author.
