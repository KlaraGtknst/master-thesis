\section{Generalized Unmasking Metrics}
\label{sec:generalized_unmasking_metrics}

\citet{bevendorff_generalizing_2019} focus on precision and sacrifice recall.
Hence, they do not use standard two-class accuracy.
Opposed to \ac{pan} \citet{bevendorff_generalizing_2019} choose to not use c@1 since it is designed for 
binary classification with equal weights for both classes.
They argue that they are primarily interested in the positive class, i.e. the same author.
Therefore, they choose the $F_0.5u$ measure where non-answers are treated as \acp{fn} as a special case of $F_0.5$:
$$\frac{(1+0.5^2)n_{tp}}{(1+0.5^2)n_{tp}+0.5^2(n_{fn}+n_{u})+n_{fp}}$$
$n_{tp}$ denoting the number of true positives, $n_{fp}$ the number of false positives, 
$n_{fn}$ the number of false negatives, and $n_{u}$ the number of unanswered problems.
$\beta=0.5$ is used to weight precision higher than recall.
