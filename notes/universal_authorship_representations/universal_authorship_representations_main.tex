\section{Universal Authorship Representations using \acp{nn}}
\label{sec:universal_authorship_representations}

\citet{rivera_soto_learning_2021} present the trade-off of neural methods:
Neural methods learn relevant features and thus, obviate the need of manual feature design, but 
at the same time these features are not explicitly identified.
Hence, the domain influence on the learned features is not clear.
Moreover, neural methods require large training datasets.
They found that neural methods are not universal.

% zero-shot transfer
\subsection{Zero-Shot Transfer}
\citet{rivera_soto_learning_2021} define zero-shot transfer as training a model on a specific domain and 
evaluating it on a held-out evaluation set from other domains. % chapter 4.1. defintion ot entirely clear

\subsection{Domain agnostic data augmentation}
\citet{rivera_soto_learning_2021} propose a simple domain agnostic data augmentation method where 
random subwords are omitted (i.e. dropout) to mask domain-specific features.
They found that it is difficult to find a suitable threshold for frequency based dropout and thus, 
resolved with random dropout.
