\section{\acs{pan} Dataset Multi-author writing style analysis}
\label{sec:pan_dataset_multi_author_writing_style_analysis}

\citet{zangerle_overview_2024} construct the dataset from user posts on Reddit.
They select a set of subreddits (i.e., topical sub-threads on Reddit) 
which they expect to yield longer and more detailed texts by individual users.
They preprocess the data by remove citations, markdown, emojis, hyperlinks, 
multiple line breaks and extra whitespaces.
For each subreddit, the texts are split into paragraphs.
For each document paragraphs of two to four authors are selected randomly, 
such that authors are even distributed across the whole dataset.
Paragraphs within a document are rearranged with respect to their similarity 
in respect of semantic and stylistic features.
Hence, easy dataset instances' paragraphs are more dissimilar 
than hard dataset instances' paragraphs (cf. \autoref{sec:pan_multi_author_writing_style_analysis}).
Each of the three levels of difficulty contains 6,000 documents 
split into training, validation and test (held back) set.
