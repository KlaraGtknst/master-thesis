The \ac{pan} workshop series accommodates shared tasks % like kaggel competitions
on authorship analysis, computational ethics, and the originality of writing \citep{ayele_overview_2024}.
\ac{pan}'s goal is to contribute to reproducible research (i.e., create benchmarks and promote studies \citep{kocher_unine_2015}) 
in the fields of \ac{ir} and \ac{nlp} \citep{ayele_overview_2024}.
Submissions are submitted to the submission software \tira{}.
Among others, the workshop includes the \textit{Generative \ac{ai} \ac{av}} task, 
which focuses on the detection of \ac{ai}-generated text.
