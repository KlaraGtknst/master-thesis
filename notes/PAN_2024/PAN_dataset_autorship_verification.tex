% acquisition
\citet{ayele_overview_2024,bevendorff_overview_2024} collected articles of major 2021 US news from Google News (Pan AI News 2021 \cite{bevendorff_overview_2024}).
They chose this time period since it predates the release of GPT-3.5 \cite{bevendorff_overview_2024,ayele_overview_2024}.
As a consequence, they claim that their dataset is most likely human-authored.
% artificial texts
Next, they used GPT-4-Turbo to create bullet-point summaries of the articles \cite{bevendorff_overview_2024,ayele_overview_2024}. 
According to \citet{bevendorff_overview_2024}, the prompt used to generate the summaries in 2021 was:
\begin{quote}
    \textit{Summarize the following text in five to six short bullet points and give an overall description
    of the genre and tone of the text.}
\end{quote}
% in JSON format:
Moreover, they extracted the article's type (nine classes), target audience (three classes), the author's political stance (three classes), the article's dateline, 
and the names and functions of directly quoted spokespersons, if any \cite{bevendorff_overview_2024}.
Based on these summaries, 15 \acp{llm}-generated newspaper articles \cite{ayele_overview_2024}.
They were prompted to assume the role of the journalist describes by the additional information extracted from the original texts \cite{bevendorff_overview_2024}.
% split
The authors split the dataset into training and test set.
% robustness
In order to test the submissions' robustness, \citet{ayele_overview_2024,bevendorff_overview_2024} generated 65 variants of the newspapers in the test split.
These variants include:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Change English to German texts
    \item Replace 15\% of the characters
    \item Cross topic: Shuffling test case pairs to break topic coherence \todo{macht es das nicht leichter?}
    \item Contrastive decoding instead of top-k/top-p sampling
    \item Cropping texts to 35 words
    \item Using the prompt from a previous Kaggle competition on \ac{llm} detection to generate more faithful paraphrases of the original articles
\end{enumerate}
