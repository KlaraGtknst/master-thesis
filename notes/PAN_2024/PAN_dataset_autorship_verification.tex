% acquisition
\citet{ayele_overview_2024} collected articles of major 2021 US news from Google News.
They chose this time period since it predates the release of GPT-3.5.
As a consequence, they claim that their dataset is most likely human-authored.
% artificial texts
Next, they used GPT-4-Turbo to create bullet-point summaries of the articles. 
Based on these summaries, 15 \acp{llm}-generated newspaper articles.
% split
The authors split the dataset into training and test set.
% robustness
In order to test the submissions' robustness, \citet{ayele_overview_2024} generated 65 variants of the newspapers in the test split.
These variants include:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Change English to German texts
    \item Replace 15\% of the characters
    \item Shuffling test case pairs to break topic coherence \todo{macht es das nicht leichter?}
    \item Contrastive decoding instead of top-k/top-p sampling
    \item Cropping texts to 35 words
    \item Using the prompt from a previous Kaggle competition on \ac{llm} detection to generate more faithful paraphrases of the original articles
\end{enumerate}
