\section{\acs{pan} evaluation}
\label{sec:pan_evaluation}

\citet{ayele_overview_2024,bevendorff_overview_2024} evaluate the participants submissions averaging the datasets' evaluation measures.
\citet{ayele_overview_2024} claim the following measures are established in \ac{av}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \ac{roc-auc}
    \item BRIER: Complement of the Brier score, in \citet{bevendorff_overview_2024}'s case equivalent to the mean squared loss.
    \item C@1: Modified version of the accuracy score, where the non-answers (abstained) are assigned the average accuracy of the remaining cases.
    \item $F_1$: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.
    \item $F_{0.5u}$: Modified version of the $F_{0.5}$ score, where the non-answers are considered \acp{fn}.
\end{itemize}
