\citet{zangerle_overview_2024} evaluate the \acs{pan} 2024 shared task on multi-author writing style analysis using 
$F_\alpha$-measure, where $\alpha$ is set to 1 and computes the harmonic mean between precision and recall equally.
The results are \todo{macro-averaged} over all documents in the test set.
