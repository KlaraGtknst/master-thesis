\label{sec:pan_multi_author_writing_style_analysis}

For a given text, find all positions of writing style change at paragraph level.
In other words: For each pair of consecutive paragraphs, 
determine whether there was a style, i.e. author, change or not \citep{zangerle_overview_2024,ayele_overview_2024}.
\citet{zangerle_overview_2024} define three levels of difficulty:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Easy}: The text contains multiple topics, 
    allowing topical changes between paragraph to be used as style change signals.
    \item \textbf{Medium}: The text has minimal topical variety, 
    requiring the approaches to focus on stylistic features for the task.
    \item \textbf{Hard}: The text's paragraph exhibit all the same topic.
\end{itemize}
