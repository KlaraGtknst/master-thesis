\citet{ayele_overview_2024} provide \autoref{tab:hierarchy_authorship_verification_problems}, i.e., 
the decomposition of \ac{av} into multiple subtasks. 
They order the subtasks in terms of their complexity.
The first task on the one hand, is considered the easiest, since we know that out of two text, one is guaranteed to be human-generated while the other one is \ac{llm}-generated.
The last task on the other hand, is denoted as the most difficult, since we do not know whether the text is human- or \ac{llm}-generated.

    where A, B corresponds to human-authored text and M denotes \ac{llm}-generated text.}

\citet{boenninghoff_o2d2_2021} state that \ac{pan} moved from a cross-topic closed-set \ac{av} task 
to cross-topic open-set \ac{av} task over three years.

\citet{boenninghoff_o2d2_2021} formally define the task:
For two documents $D_1$ and $D_2$, ground-truth hypothesis $H_a$ for $a \in \{0,1\}$ 
where $a=1$ means that $D_1$ and $D_2$ are written by the same author and 
$a=0$ means that they are not written by the same author, find $f: \{D_1, D_2\} \rightarrow p \in [0,1]$.
The estimated label $\hat{a}$ is then determined by the threshold $\theta$ applied to $p$:
$$\hat{a}=\left\{ \begin{matrix}
1\text{ if }p > 0.5 \\
0\text{ if }p < 0.5 \\
non-response\text{ if }p\text{ close to }0.5
\end{matrix}\right\}$$
These rules lead to three hypotheses:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $H_0$: $D_1$ and $D_2$ are written by different authors
    \item $H_1$: $D_1$ and $D_2$ are written by the same author
    \item $H_2$: Undecidable, trial does not suffice to establish authorship
\end{itemize}
