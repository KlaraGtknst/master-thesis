\citet{koppel_authorship_2011} define coverage as the percentage of unseen texts, i.e. snippets, 
for which the score $\sigma$ is obtained.
They define the probability of the predicted author being the true author as 
$$\frac{p * H * P}{p * + (1-p) * E}$$
where $p$ is the prior probability of the true author being in the candidate set (defined by user),
$P$ is the precision (i.e. the proportion of true positives among the predicted authors),
$E$ is the propobility of a candidate author achieving a score $\sigma$ if the true author is not among the candidate authors.
