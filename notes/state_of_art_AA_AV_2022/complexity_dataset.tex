\citet{tyo_state_2022} claim that the number of documents per author and the number of words per document is 
a better indicator of the complexity of the dataset than the number of authors, documents or words.
Many authors with small number of documents per authors is considered hard.
In terms of \ac{aa} dataset complexity, the imbalance, i.e. standard deviation of the number of documents per author, 
is the best indicator of the dataset complexity.
