\section{\ac{pan} \ac{aa} \& \ac{av} metrics}
\label{sec:pan_aa_av_metrics}

The \todo{F0.5u, C@1, and Brier Score metrics} are used to evaluate the ability of \ac{av} methods 
to abstain from hard samples \cite{tyo_state_2022}.
For each sample, a score $\in [0, 1]$ is assigned to the sample.
A score of exactly 0.5 means the model abstains from the sample \cite{tyo_state_2022,bevendorff_overview_2024,kocher_unine_2015}.

The AUC metric is used to evaluate the ability of methods to rank predictions.
No threshold is required.
\ac{pan} ignores any abstained samples when calculating the AUC metric \cite{tyo_state_2022}.

% != PAN
\citet{tyo_state_2022} chose to adopt the macro-averaged accuracy metric, so-called macro-accuracy, for \ac{aa}, 
and AUC \ac{av} tasks.
