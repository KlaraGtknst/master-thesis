\section{Deep learning methods}
\label{sec:deep_learning_methods}

Deep learning methods such as recurrent neural networks, transformers, word embeddings, and byte-pair encoding \citep{tyo_state_2022}.
In the \citet{tyo_state_2022}' survey, they include work from 2020 stating CNNs are no longer competitive.

\citet{tyo_state_2022} claim that since \ac{av} methods are binary classification problems (i.e.\ same author or not), 
opposed to \ac{aa} problems, the datasets have very large number of words per class. 
Hence, \ac{av} formulations are more effective for training deep learning methods.
