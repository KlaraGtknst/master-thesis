\section{\ac{llm} detection as an \ac{av} task}
\label{sec:llm_detection_av}

\citet{llm_detection_av_2025} claim that opposed to common belief, the task of detecting \ac{llm} generated text is not an \ac{aa} task,
i.e., a closed-set binary classification where both classes are sufficiently discriminative, 
but an \ac{av} task, i.e., an open-set one-class classification problem. 

\subsection{\ac{llm} vs human text}

% differences
\citet{llm_detection_av_2025} claim that it is unclear how exactly \ac{llm} generated text differs from human text.
Research so far has observed, that \ac{llm} generated text lacks lexical diversity, 
overuses certain adjectives ("commendable", "innovative", "meticulous", etc.) and produces longer, more complex sentences.
Moreover, \acp{llm} possess stylistic fingerprints and memorize patterns from the training data.
% lengths
While \citet{llm_detection_av_2025} found the average word length of human texts across datasets is 5.1 $\pm$ 0.1 charcters, 
which matches the excepted value for English, 
words in \ac{llm} generated text are significantly longer (>5.4 characters).
Text length is genre-dependent, however, human texts have generally longtailed distributions, 
while \ac{llm} generated texts have narrow stopping windows. 
% entropy
According to \citet{llm_detection_av_2025}, apart from the newest closed-source models, 
\acp{llm} struggle to produce sufficiently many new words and characters to match the entropy of human text.
Strategies for higher entropy include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item being more human-like
    \item penalizing repetitive sampling
    \item writing nonsensical gibberish
\end{itemize}
Character n-grams entropy alone is a weak discriminator, 
but can give an upper bound for minimum non-zero text length requirements for separation (below limit texts are indistinguishable) and 
establishes a baseline how human text is distributed \citep{llm_detection_av_2025}.

% similarities
However, due to Nucleus sampling (i.e.\ top-p sampling: Sampling next token from subset of $p$ most probable tokens) 
among other advances, generated text adheres better to human text characteristics.
% artifacts is AE, artefacts is BE
Newer \acp{llm} are able to produce fewer pathological language artefacts \citep{llm_detection_av_2025}.

\subsection{\ac{llm} detectors}

As \acp{llm} advanced, basic heuristics applied by human detectors no longer suffice.
However, experienced ChatGPT users can still detect generated text due to their prior experience.

\subsection{Assumptions}

% future of LLMs
According to \citet{llm_detection_av_2025}, one core assumption as of today is that 
language distributions of human-authored and machine-generated text are sufficiently distinct due to training data or technology.
\citet{llm_detection_av_2025} argue that this assumption is not true, since 
(1) the distance of the distributions depends on the feature space used, which is not specified, and
(2) human text is assumed to be uniform across all authors.
Instead, \citet{llm_detection_av_2025} argue that \acp{llm} will become more human-like and thus, 
\ac{llm} detection will increasingly resemble a human authorship classification task.

% dataset requirements
Currently, benchmarks should be designed to be diverse and include many (low quality) documents in order to make the benchmark more robust.
\citet{llm_detection_av_2025} argue that these datasets are not representative given the one-class nature of the problem.
Consequently, these datasets will not find good detectors and increase the Type-II error rate.

% scores
\citet{llm_detection_av_2025} argue that maintaining a low \ac{fpr} is more important than high accuracy.
This idea is core of the \ac{roc} analysis.
However, low \ac{fpr} and high accuracy are both possible to achieve if non-answers are a valid third option.
Abstaining from answering can be achieved by using a meta learner that can abstain from answering if the confidence is low, 
or to use \ac{svm} hyperplane distances to calibrate precision thresholds.

\subsection{Evaluation metrics}
Metrics also include c@1.
\citet{llm_detection_av_2025} argue that the reduction from the \ac{fpr}-\ac{tpr} curve of \ac{roc} to a single \ac{roc-auc} number 
comes with information loss due to the absence of a fixed threshold and trade-off.
Moreover, \ac{roc}'s \ac{fpr} and \ac{tpr} are independent of class prevalence, which is desirable.
However, in highly imbalanced class scenarios \ac{roc} can be misleading (overly optimistic or pessimistic).

\subsection{Dataset \& \acp{llm} for \ac{llm} detection} 
\citet{llm_detection_av_2025} propose to use the \ac{pan}'24, Human Detectors, Ghostbuster, RAID, MAGE, M4 dataset for \ac{llm} detection.
The datasets are preprocessed by removing extremely short texts, texts with adversarial attacks (i.e.\ obfuscation), 
low-quality texts created by older models, prompt artefacts and the peer review genre.
\acp{llm} used for \ac{llm} detection are \texttt{GPT-3.x}, \texttt{GPT-4}, \texttt{LLaMA2}, \texttt{Mistral}, \texttt{GPT-4o}, 
\texttt{GPT-4o-mini}, and \texttt{OpenAI o1}.
