\section{O2O2 for \ac{av}}
\label{sec:o2o2_av}

\citet{boenninghoff_o2d2_2021} define different types of uncertainty in \ac{av}:
% aleatoric
In \ac{av}, aleatoric or data uncertainty is associated with properties of the data pairs.
Examples include topical variations or the intra- and inter-authorship variability.
Aleatoric uncertainty is not reducible but can be addressed to a certain degree 
by returning a non-response if it is too large for a reliable decision.
% epistemic
Epistemic or model uncertainty is associated with the model parameters.
Examples include unseen authors or topics.
Epistemic uncertainty can be reduced by training the model on more data.
