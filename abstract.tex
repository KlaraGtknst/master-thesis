In this thesis, we extend an \acl{av} method proposed by \citet{koppel_determining_2014}. 
The original \impAppr{} compares a disputed text to a candidate text and hard negatives, considering disputed and candidate text to share an author if the candidate is consistently the most similar across random feature projections. 
A key limitation is the lack of control for confounding factors such as topic or genre, which can lead to decisions based on domain differences rather than authorial style. 
To address this, we use \acs{llm}-generated paraphrases as proxies for modelling the original generation of the candidate text, aiming to control domain-related confounders during \imp{} generation. 
Our experimental results indicate that the \acs{llm}-based \impAppr{} outperforms baseline methods in the traditional \acl{av} setting with human-authored text pairs, while simultaneously highlighting the challenges associated with integrating \acsp{llm} into \acl{av} and emphasizing the necessity of further research on paraphrase generation.
