In this thesis, we extend a \acl{av} method proposed by \citet{koppel_determining_2014}. 
The original impostors method compares a disputed text to a candidate text and hard negatives, considering disputed and candidate text to share an author if the candidate is consistently the most similar across random feature projections. 
A key limitation is the lack of control for confounding factors such as topic or genre, which can lead to decisions based on domain differences rather than authorial style. 
To address this, we use \acs{llm}-generated paraphrases as proxies for modelling the original generation of the candidate text, aiming to control domain-related confounders during \imp{} generation. 
Our experiments show that, the \acs{llm}-based impostors method does not outperform baseline approaches across multiple \acl{av} tasks, highlighting the challenges of integrating \acsp{llm} into authorship verification and the need for further research on generating paraphrases.
